  <h2 id="start">Prologue</h2>

  <p>
    The Universe has become old and craggy and has turned around on itself, now
    falling inward to the primordial chaos from which it emerged some forty or
    fifty billion years earlier. Civilizations have come and gone. We focus our
    attention on one. Whether or not the inhabitants resemble humans is
    unclear, but because they act like humans, we might as well take them to
    look that way, too.…
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter One</div>Signing On (In the
  Classical Style)</h2>

  <p>
    Stringer was tall and slender, even skinny; that may have been why he was
    called Stringer to begin with. On the other hand, the name may have been no
    more than a Bitter sound, signifying nothing, which we write as
    <q>Stringer.</q> It is not clear which is the case; it is also unclear
    whether it makes any difference whatsoever. So it will be left at that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer had thin, jet-black hair, the kind that was impossible to keep out
    of his eyes and which made him look perpetually wet, as if he had just come
    in out of the rain. This time, however, he was wet—to the bone—and in the
    rain. It wasn't a feeling he liked. This time, it was one of those nasty,
    windy nights—too cold for summer—that could convince Stringer his whole
    life was a feeling he didn't like. The rain was not only cold but green,
    bright like Stringer's eyes. Green rain, green snow—on the rare instances
    when it came—green eyes against gray-green skin. There must be copper in
    the water. Stringer used to wonder about things like that, but no longer;
    he thought it a waste of time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pausing for a moment, stooped over as usual, feet ankle-deep in water,
    Stringer turned up the corner of his battered cloak around his neck. He
    delved into his pocket and pulled out the imprinted card that kept track of
    his wages. The numbers glowed, the day's balance displayed on a thin layer
    of liquid crystal. Not much, he thought, but enough to keep him
    alive. Working as a machinist down in the transport shops was hard only on
    his back. Perhaps he would stick at it another week before moving on to
    something else.
  </p>

  <p>
    The heavy patter of rain continued, not interested in stopping. Stringer
    turned the corner on which he was standing and walked across the street to
    the rail stop. He jostled his way through the crowd closer to the platform
    for a better shot at the next one that came by. The rail arrived a few
    minutes later, already overfilled. It did not come close to stopping, but
    in the moment during which it slowed, Stringer sighted a strap left vacant
    by a disembarking passenger and jumped for it. He caught the strap and hung
    on, precariously tottering over the back trolley. Another potential
    passenger missed his strap and slipped off, perhaps to be crushed by the
    rattling train of wheels. For a brief instant, Stringer felt his body move
    reflexively to help the man, but he stifled the urge and instead laughed to
    himself, as he knew the other passengers were doing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ten minutes later or so, he released his strap and jumped off. There was no
    paved road here. He splashed along in the mud past shops that were pieced
    together with wood or metal or anything else that would hold them
    up. Glancing over his shoulder, he could see the lights of the skyscrapers
    that dominated the distant skyline. A queer mixture, this town, Pass-Under
    Transhi.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sign glowed <q>Elswer's,</q> clearly, even in the rain. Stringer
    ducked into the half-open door, pulling it shut behind him. Elswer's was
    packed that night, probably because of the bad weather. Stringer shook
    himself off on the entrance platform while looking for some familiar
    faces. He saw too many of them. Every vagabond this side of the Transhi
    mountains must be here. He walked slowly down the steps into the main hall,
    almost expecting to trip over a body lying on the stairs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Filldirt">Stringer, you rat!</q> Stringer lurched forward as
    a sharp slap caught him on the back. <q ab:speaker="Filldirt">Sit with
    us.</q> It was Filldirt. (At least that is a literal—if not
    appropriate—translation of his name.) The only thing Stringer knew about
    Filldirt was that he existed. That was enough. <q ab:speaker="Filldirt">So
    what do you say, Stringer, old man? I haven't seen you in quite a
    while.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Old man.</q> Stringer nodded. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Give me something to drink.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Filldirt">My pleasure. Give this man some kob!</q> Filldirt
    bellowed to one of the attendants, and a round of drinks was brought
    instantly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer sat down with his fingers curled around a warm cup. The room was
    large, but with beams so low that you could break your skull on them if you
    weren't careful. It also smelled. It smelled of bodies, of warm kob, of
    dirt, of all the things with which Stringer lived. The roof, made of tin,
    was rotten and looked as if it would cave in momentarily, but it had always
    looked that way for as long as Stringer knew of the place. And for as long
    as he knew of the place he had never found out who Elswer was. The patrons,
    never sure who was the real one, called all the attendants Elswer, and the
    attendants, all responding to that name, of course, never let on,
    either. Elswer's. A rattletrap of a flophouse on a rattletrap of a
    planet. (In fact, the name of this planet might be loosely rendered as
    <q>Two-Bit,</q> which adequately reflects the sentiment of the
    inhabitants.)
  </p>

  <p>
    If Filldirt had not called his attention to it, Stringer never would have
    noticed the conversation that was being held in shadow at the next
    table. Three men, partially hidden behind post and beam, were engaged in a
    discussion consisting as much of raised mugs, flailing arms, flashing
    grins, and twinkling eyes as of verbal exchange.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well, my good man, I've had some preliminary tests run
    on your sample, and my guess is that you have something. I may be willing
    to back you if you can be sure of getting to your city.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig">Hendig says he shall get you there, and so I
    shall.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The third man joined in. All Stringer could see of him was a giant beard
    jutting out from behind a post, incredibly muscular arms occasionally
    pounding on the table, and a large gray sack resting near his foot. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Tseems to me to find that navigator will be more
    than an unlikely trick, yuh?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Unfortunately true. Not a very poetical solution to
    the problem, but it seems it will have to suffice. What do you say,
    Valyavar?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Sometimes, to be sure, it is difficult to
    distinguish between saints and maniacs. But if it is to be worth six or
    seven years to you, I'm for it. We'll get a lot of sleep at least.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer could only catch bits and pieces of this conversation, which he
    found indecipherable and not of any great interest, so he stopped paying
    attention and went back to his kob.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Filldirt">So, Stringer,</q> Filldirt said, <q
    ab:speaker="Filldirt">what do you think of this man Hendig's story?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer looked up at Filldirt uncomprehendingly. Filldirt was an idiot, and
    Stringer had never liked him. Why they were sitting together he didn't
    know. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Sorry.</q> He shook his head.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Two-Bit woman 1">You haven't heard about Hendig, then?</q> a woman
    who was leaning on Filldirt's shoulder piped up. She had a great deal of
    cosmotron blue on her face. To Stringer it looked hideous. <q
    ab:speaker="TWo-Bit woman 1">Hendig tells us that he found a new planet around some
    star nearby. I keep forgetting its name.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Barythron,</q> interrupted one of the three men at the
    next table who had stood up to order a drink. He paused and leaned over
    Stringer's table. <q ab:speaker="Pike">It's about as far as we've gotten
    from here. About ten light-years. A rather interesting tale Hendig has told
    me. He claims to have found a truly amazing city, complete with fabulous
    treasures and mysterious forces. And he tops the whole story off by saying
    the inhabitants don't even know the city is there. Quite a tale, I'd say,
    my young friend.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer glanced up at the man. He was indeed several—though not many—years
    older than himself, perhaps as tall, perhaps not, but certainly more
    huskily built, and wore a beard trimmed to a point. The scar that ran from
    the corner of his mouth to the corner of left eye indicated a vigorously
    used life. But this scar and the fine lines that crisscrossed the forehead
    could not disguise the bright enthusiasm for that life which the entire
    face radiated. Stringer blew across the mouth of his mug and turned his
    attention to the coarse grain of the wood in the table. He scratched at it
    and a splinter came off in his forefinger. He pulled it out with his
    teeth. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You seem to believe him,</q> he said,
    staring at the splinter of wood he had just extracted.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Ah yes, I do. There is some evidence that Hendig,
    contrary to reputation, has not fabricated the entire tale. And I have not
    told you all of it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Two-Bit woman 1">Hendig says the planet is one hundred times
    the diameter of Two-Bit,</q> said the woman next to Filldirt, a sharp nod
    stamping her confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Two-Bit woman 2">With no nights and days—</q> said a second
    woman.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Two-Bit woman 1">—and you can even stand up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What do you say, Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer took a gulp of kob, swallowing it slowly, thinking over the
    taste. He inclined his head to one side. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do the
    inhabitants have three heads and five arms?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Filldirt looked uneasy to Stringer, but as Filldirt always looked uneasy,
    Stringer paid no attention and went back to his kob, staring at the little
    bubbles rimming the mug.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">But Hendig swears—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">People also swear that Two-Bit is a fit place to
    live. I never believed them, either.</q> The mug was cracked, Stringer
    noticed, and bubbles tended to collect at the small fissure.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Filldirt">Be careful of what you say, Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Was that Filldirt again? <q ab:speaker="Stringer">As usual,</q> Stringer
    heard himself say.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second of the three men at the other table rose from behind the post
    and strode over. <q ab:speaker="Hendig">Are you calling me a liar?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer glanced upward and pushed a strand of black hair away from bright
    green eyes. The man was very big, husky, cleanshaven, and craggy. He must
    have stood two meters easily. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Are you Hendig?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig">Yes, so Sarek has brought forth.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Then I suppose I am,</q> Stringer mused, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">calling you a liar.</q> Stringer's forefinger traced
    the mug's rim in slow circles.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Filldirt">Watch it, Stringer,</q> Filldirt warned, moving
    away from him. <q ab:speaker="Filldirt">Life is cheap on Two-Bit.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Nothing new, Stringer thought. The only people who lived on Two-Bit were
    dumped there by birth or other accident and couldn't get off.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig">Look,</q> Hendig said, spitting on the floor. <q
    ab:speaker="Hendig">Hendig has spent the last six years of his life getting
    to and from that planet.  Friends I left behind grew old without me. You,
    look at you. This one was probably just learning how to stand on his own
    two feet when I left here more than twenty years ago. And since you
    couldn't have known Hendig then, I would keep your mouth shut.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I still don't believe you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Filldirt">Stringer!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Giving no warning, Hendig slammed Stringer on the shoulder and sent him
    straight into another table. As he struggled to his feet the table
    capsized, scattering wood and ceramic to the floor with a loud
    crash. Milky-white kob, steaming, found its way quickly into the cracks
    between battered planks underfoot. Already a large space had cleared, and
    the room fell quiet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer straightened, rubbing his elbow. Slowly he cleared his throat. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Is that a challenge?</q> His skinny body looked
    fairly dwarfed by Hendig's bulk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hendig grinned in return. <q ab:speaker="Hendig">First I am going to cut
    the hair off your head to within the width of an ant's eyebrow. Then—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Spare the details.</q> Stringer drew his kalan, a
    fighting knife almost a meter long, very slender, and razor-sharp on three
    sides.  He glanced about him. Not only Hendig but his two companions, the
    first who had spoken about the planet, the second with the great beard, and
    even Filldirt himself now faced him across the room, four kalans unsheathed
    to one. Stringer was satisfied with the odds. After all, life was cheap on
    Two-Bit, including his own.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hendig was rushing him. He moved very fast for his size, Stringer saw, and
    so kept out of the way on the first pass. Then he watched as Hendig's body
    and his own appeared, as if seen by an independent observer, to slip into
    slow motion. Every nerve in his body was now consciously connected to his
    brain. A millimeter twist of the forefinger, a half-centimeter shift of the
    right leg; all registered. Hendig held the kalan high. Too high for his
    size, thought Stringer in a fraction of a heartbeat. Hendig's blade is in
    line; he is pressing forward. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Feel the pressure on
    your blade,</q> Stringer's wrist signaled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Hendig
    is off balance,</q> the mind decided. This will be easy, just a drop to the
    knee.
  </p>

  <p>
    But no. From the periphery of his eye came the signal that Filldirt was
    lumbering in. A change of strategy is necessary. Head low. Stretch to the
    left; get your left leg out of the way. This should take care of them both.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer felt his hair brush against the floor and his left knee press hard
    against the coarse wood. His knuckle relayed the message of slight
    resistance as he felt his blade penetrate Filldirt's stomach. The sudden
    force on his outstretched right leg told him that Hendig had tripped over
    his foot.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer spun around, catching Hendig on the flank with the tip of his
    kalan, and jumped up, only to find himself restrained by half a dozen arms
    and his hands locked in the grip of the giant with the great
    beard. Stringer glanced into that giant's eyes, coal-black and burning. He
    flinched. Even after his body had been released and his hands freed, the
    eyes still held him pinioned, not from the slightest threat of danger or
    physical harm, but from a deep, almost mournful compassion, which Stringer
    could not fathom.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally Stringer forced himself to turn away. Hendig was sprawled on the
    floor, clasping his wounded flank and glaring up at him. Filldirt's body
    lay in a growing pool of blood that would fill the cracks between the
    planks and become a nuisance to clean. Stringer looked at the silent crowd
    around him. He hoped they had enjoyed the brawl; it did have the unusual
    element of two opponents almost immediately skewered, one
    permanently. Stringer laughed to himself, ducked under a low beam, and left
    Elswer's.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rain hadn't stopped, and it was still chilly. Stringer tucked his cloak
    around his neck and headed up the street. His quick walk turned into a trot
    as he ignored those he slammed into along the way. People were out even in
    the rain. Was there a place on Two-Bit where there weren't people?
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer stopped abruptly when he felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned
    rapidly, half drawing his kalan.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Hold on, now! No harm meant.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    It was one of those three men at Elswer's, the one who had spoken of
    Hendig's planet, the one who had faced him off with the others but
    refrained from entering the fight.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Cold night for a walk, wouldn't you say?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Nothing better to do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I noticed you make friends quickly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer jerked away.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Now, hold on, fellow; I'm not trying to get you
    angry.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You're talking about the rehearsal back there?</q>
    Stringer kept walking, his cloak dipping into the puddles with each stride.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Rehearsal?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Practice.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The other man smiled as he caught up with Stringer. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">I've never seen anyone move so fast.…And you were willing
    to take on four of us—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">One or a hundred, what's the difference?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Some men, in my estimation, would think
    twice. Especially before tangling with Hendig and Filldirt. You only
    touched Hendig's kalan once—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">—twice—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">—before you had him. If Filldirt hadn't rushed in, I
    would now be sorely missing my invaluable colleague. And Filldirt; he was
    good—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">A tyro. He couldn't handle a kalan to save his
    life.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I would disagree.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">He's dead.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Nonetheless—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The evidence is in my favor.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Humph. As you wish.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">They were slow and forceful. You win by speed and
    agility.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, so it would seem. Where did you learn to fight
    like that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer pursed his lips. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Everyone on Two-Bit
    knows how to fight. Life's cheap, remember?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Ah, yes, the planetary slogan. Well, don't you feel
    anything now that you've killed a man?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I've killed men before; no doubt I'll do it
    again—until someone kills me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">But you didn't answer the question.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do I feel? Rehearsed. It was a good
    exercise.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The other turned away, and a light from a nearby window caught his
    half-pursed lips.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer suddenly stopped his brisk walk for the second time. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you want?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I want you to go to Hendig's World, naturally.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You do?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">He wasn't lying.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">That entire <q>rehearsal,</q> as you call it, was a
    waste of your talents. Hendig wasn't lying, I'm telling you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The reason I fought him had nothing to do with his
    lying or not. He challenged me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You provoked him.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I was being straightforward and honest, as I am
    with everybody.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Everybody but yourself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer whirled around with a glare in his eye and a raised fist.  <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Sarek, what do you want, a kalan in your gizzard? I'll
    be happy to supply—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Now, don't go nonlinear on me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer lowered his fist. He had never heard the expression
    <q>nonlinear</q> before, but it made sense. He smiled <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer"><q>Nonlinear.</q> Where did you get it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Somewhere or other. I don't know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, what do you want, anyway?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I told you: I want you to go to Hendig's World with
    me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The rain continued. A drop fell from Stringer's hood to his cloak and he
    wiped it off.  <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You really believe him, don't
    you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Look,</q> the other replied, putting his arm around
    Stringer's shoulder, <q ab:speaker="Pike">I've got something he brought
    back. I'm not sure what it is yet. We're running tests. But it's a metal,
    so I'd guess, a ring at that, lighter than magnesium and incredibly
    strong. A plasma torch won't even touch it. It takes everything we've got
    to blast through. I've never seen anything like it. And Hendig says there
    is more of the stuff just lying about, as if it had been abandoned all of a
    sudden. Much more, he tells me, as well as other treasures. It's worth the
    risk, I believe; don't you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That's all?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well, when the tests are finished, we can make a final
    decision, but I will tell you frankly that my nose is more accurate than
    any tests. Whatever that material is, it will be worth it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer ducked under a nearby awning to avoid the rain. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I mean, that's all you want?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">It's enough, isn't it? It might also be of interest to
    find out if the place is as big as Hendig said it was. Impossible, of
    course.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shrugged.  <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I wouldn't know.</q>
  </p>


  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You're a simply marvelous fellow, do you realize that?
    Simply marvelous. Why don't you come with me to my place? I've got
    something to show you.</q> He pulled Stringer out onto the road again and
    they began trotting briskly up the muddy street, past the ramshackle
    dwellings that seemed not merely content to exist but to propagate
    exponentially in such sections of town. When they reached the main road,
    Stringer's companion punched a call box for a private cab, the two climbed
    in, and the stranger punched for a destination.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">People who use taxis have little need for
    Elswer's.</q>
  </p>


  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">One goes where business takes him, my young man.…Tell
    me,</q> he continued as he undid his parka, <q ab:speaker="Pike">what's
    your name, good fellow?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Stringer.</q>
  </p>


  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Ah, yes, I had forgotten. Friends call me Pike. Good
    enough?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Okay.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike laughed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What's wrong?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Nothing at all, nothing at all.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The taxi stopped after about twenty minutes. With a flick of the wrist Pike
    popped his credit card into the tabulator, lifted on his hood again, and
    was once more out into the rain. Stringer followed in like manner and found
    himself standing next to the shadowy form of a tall building. He had seen
    it many times before. It was the headquarters of the Two-Bit Transportation
    Corporation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shrugged and followed Pike into the elevator shaft. A door opened;
    it closed and opened again. The apartment that faced them was unlike any
    Stringer had ever recalled. The thick draperies that hung suspended from
    ceiling to floor were characteristic of the entire room. A fireplace
    occupied one corner of a sunken pit in the center. The blue and green
    couches blended into the carpet almost indistinguishably. The whole gave
    Stringer an indescribable sensation, one that combined the desire to sleep,
    to retch, and the strong feeling that he was in the wrong place.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">This belongs to you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Stringer, that's very clever of you to guess,
    indeed. Care for a drink?</q> Pike produced two mugs from an alabaster
    cabinet and filled them, offering one to Stringer. Stringer shook his head
    at the extended hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you own the whole corporation?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">As much as any one person owns it. Why don't you take
    off your cloak? It's dry in here, you know. You can even sit down if you
    want.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'll sit down.</q> Stringer left his cloak. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">What did you want to show me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Oh, yes, that. Come.</q> Pike crossed to the other
    side of the room. The heavy curtains parted at the push of a button.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer stood up, felt dizzy, and shook his head. Stand up, he told
    himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What's wrong?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Nothing.</q> Then Stringer looked directly into
    Pike's eyes. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you ever feel, at night, somebody
    is trying to talk to you, pull you apart in all directions; some part of
    your mind, way down, like a nightmare that is part of yourself?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike took a step backward. <q ab:speaker="Pike">No, never. Some of us are
    in control of our faculties.…Well, come and take a look.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer walked over and peered out the window. It was a long way
    down. Although it was dark, strong lights cut through the night to
    illuminate a runway and some low-lying hangars off to one side. There were
    several ships on the field, needle-sharp noses and swept-back wings
    gleaming in the rain.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You see, those are just the shuttles. The big ships
    are up there.</q> Pike lifted his eyes skyward. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Interstellar travel will soon become big business, I
    hope. It's time for Two-Bit to start branching out. We've used up this
    solar system and a few others. If you don't believe me, I can take you for
    a ride up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Okay, now what do you want?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Stringer, for an obviously intelligent man, you are
    not acting very brightly. I've told you several times already that I want
    you to come with me to Hendig's World.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What makes you think I'm so intelligent?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">People who talk like you are either very stupid, with
    nothing in their heads, or very intelligent and have something to hide. I
    suspect you are in the latter category. Tell me, do you know how to
    read?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Occasionally.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Occasionally?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I try to avoid it. Reading confuses, slows down
    thinking.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Speed and deception, is that it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why do you care?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You don't think you'd like a drink?</q> Pike held out
    his hand again. Stringer shook his head a second time. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">I don't want any uneducated bumpkins on this trip. If you
    are intelligent, you can be trained to think, and if you are quick—as you
    amply demonstrated—you can be even more useful. We may be going to a very
    dangerous place. Clear enough? Besides, I think you'd get along well with
    the rest of the crew I have chosen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Who are they?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You've met them. Hendig, for one—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer laughed and turned away. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You've got to be
    kidding.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">—and Valyavar, for another.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Who?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">The big man with the beard.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer whirled around and stepped toward the door. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I told you, I'm not going.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You've said nothing of the sort. Tell me, are you good
    with machines?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">If anything.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Electronics? Mechanics?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Odd jobs here and there. Mindless. I try to avoid
    permanence.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Speed and deception again?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">If you like.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Do you know how to write?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer chuckled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">My name, at least.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike smiled. <q ab:speaker="Pike">You can't be too sure these days. I don't
    know what's happening to the world. People don't read and write any
    more.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Who needs to?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">One always needs to. Well, shall we begin?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head a final time. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You are very
    sure that I am going with you, aren't you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike laughed, almost guffawed. Then he looked Stringer straight in the
    eye. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, I am quite sure.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer put up his hood and walked to the elevator. Just as it opened for
    him, he turned around, lowered his hood again, and gazed back at Pike. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">All right, I'll go. But just remember one thing,
    quite straight: I don't like you much.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike grinned. <q ab:speaker="Pike">My good fellow, that's fine by me. I ask
    you only to remember one thing in return.…</q> Then Pike's grin turned into
    a frown. <q ab:speaker="Pike">It is not wise to argue with me.…Now, shall we
    get to work?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    This time Stringer nodded, and that was that.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Two</div>Casting Off</h2>

  <p>
    It was now almost a year to the day since Stringer had first met Pike, and
    a year after Stringer had expected to leave. If it had been up to him, once
    he had decided to go, Stringer would have leaped on the rocket and departed
    immediately for Hendig's World. Evidently Pike had other ideas. In fact, at
    first the preparations had moved so slowly that Stringer was not sure they
    were going to leave at all. But then, one day, the final go-ahead came and
    Pike's plans proceeded in all fervor.
  </p>

  <p>
    That day, perhaps a month or so after the initial meeting, Stringer had
    been in the shooting gallery, practicing. He had been spending more and
    more time there lately, expending more and more energy on the deadly
    concentration. He liked the feeling it gave to his body.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer faced the far wall and watched from the corner of his eye a little
    ball roll off a ramp and fall in a lazy parabola to the floor. Relaxed,
    Stringer waited for it to fall halfway, then raised his pistol in a motion
    invisibly fast and vaporized the ball a centimeter from the floor. Stringer
    glanced at his pistol. Pike had told him that it was a graser: a gamma ray
    or nuclear laser. Stringer didn't know what that was and doubted that Pike
    did, either. He shrugged, watched the next ball fall, pushed slightly faster
    than the last, and vaporized that one, too. It was easy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar was there, also. Valyavar might have had another name, but
    Stringer had never heard it, not in the short time since they had first
    met. He heard very little from Valyavar, and after that first encounter at
    Elswer's, had made a point of avoiding him. However, Stringer did enjoy
    watching the granite giant's daily entrance into the training
    center. Valyavar would kick open the door, march in with his sack thrown
    over his shoulder, and wipe his sleeve. He would throw his sack into the
    corner, unwrap the scarf he was wearing around his neck with a single twirl
    of the arm, throw that on top of the sack, and then do the same with his
    cloak. All but simultaneously, he would fish some mottled weed from the
    sporran attached to his belt, and, within a moment, an expertly rolled
    cigarette, done with a single hand, would be protruding from the great
    beard that covered his face almost to his eyes. Then, taller by a head, he
    would nod down to Stringer and start to work.
  </p>

  <p>
    The whole process was carried through with such elan that Stringer found he
    could only smile. But he still avoided Valyavar's eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
    At that same moment Pike was in his office discussing the preparations with
    Hendig, who had recently recovered from his wound, when an animated figure
    burst into the room, carrying the metal ring that Hendig had given Pike as
    proof of the journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Have you finished testing that ring?</q> Pike asked,
    pointing to the object in the man's hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="scientist">Ahh, yes. We have.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike saw that the scientist was excited. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well, please
    continue.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="scientist">I don't supposed you have a blackboard around?
    How can I explain anything without a blackboard?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I suggest that you do your best.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="scientist">Well,</q> the man replied, hesitated, and then
    proceeded in one quick breath, <q ab:speaker="scientist">whatever it is,
    it's at least ninety-nine percent metallic hydrogen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What's that, may I ask?</q> Pike raised his eyebrows
    and scribbled <q>metallic hydrogen</q> on a notepad.
  </p>

  <p>
    The scientist paced back and forth, staring first at the floor, then at the
    ceiling, then picked a piece of lint off his worn shoe. <q
    ab:speaker="scientist">We've never been able to make it. Most people gave
    up long ago and said that it never existed, at least in the quantity and
    form that had been predicted by theory. You see, it used to be thought that
    if you cooled hydrogen down to almost absolute zero and then compressed it
    with pressures characteristically of several million atmospheres</q>—the
    man squeezed his fist shut—<q ab:speaker="scientist">two things would
    happen. First, it would heat back up to room temperature from adiabatic
    compression. Secondly, and more importantly, it would turn into a solid
    because of the pressure. A solid metal, you see, of course, because the
    electrons were being squeezed into the conduction bands—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Now, hold on a minute, this is a little too
    four-dimensional for me. Can you reduce it to three?</q> Pike's request was
    ignored, and he leaned across his desk to Hendig. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">These fellows are really impossible once they get
    started.</q> Then he wrote on his pad in capital letters, <q>NO
    SCIENTISTS</q>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="scientist">It would almost certainly be a superconductor;
    you put a current in a loop of the stuff—this ring—</q> the scientist said,
    tapping the specimen, <q ab:speaker="scientist">and it goes around forever
    without decaying.  The current produces a strong poloidal field around the
    loop. That's why that plasma torch wouldn't touch this ring. The magnetic
    field protected it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I see,</q> Pike said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="scientist">What's more, and this is the most interesting
    point, it was speculated that metallic hydrogen would remain solid and
    superconducting once the pressure was removed at room temperature. Here it
    is. This ring. It seems to be alloyed or coated—we haven't determined which
    yet—to make it very strong and resistant, stable rather than
    metastable. Naturally, it is also the lightest metal you'll ever see.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Are you quite finished?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="scientist">Yes, quite,</q> the visitor said, nodding
    sharply. <q ab:speaker="scientist">Except that a spherical liar is a liar
    from any direction you look at him, and we've examined Hendig's story from
    all angles. You're an optimum fool if you believe what he tells you about
    that planet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike jotted the words <q>optimum fool</q> on his pad. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">So, maybe Master Hendig is a spherical liar and I am an
    optimum fool for believing in a nonexistent planet, in which case I ask you
    a simple question: if you can't produce the metallic hydrogen, where did
    that ring come from?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="scientist">Ah, well, I…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Thank you for your most interesting information. Now,
    I suggest you get back to your laboratory and write up your report for one
    of your obscure journals.</q> Pike waved the man out of the room.
  </p>

  <p>
    The scientist left the office muttering under his breath.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike sighed. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Can you imagine listening to that for an
    entire expedition? We would never get off the ground with his constant
    nit-picking. If that was a bid to get me to take him along, he certainly
    had a misconception of what this expedition was about. I put this to you:
    who needs a scientist on an economic venture?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Hendig shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Hendig">If he doesn't believe Hendig, let
    him rot.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike laughed. <q ab:speaker="Pike">You are something of a poet, Hendig, and
    your tendency to bask in hyperbole is well known. I will not be surprised
    to find a planet twice as big as Two-Bit or one with days twice
    as long. I will
    expect to find this hydrogen. Now, in that matter, I suggest we call in
    Stringer and Valyavar and tell them the good news.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Within ten minutes Stringer and Valyavar had been located and brought up to
    the office. After he entered, Stringer walked to the opposite side of the
    room and faced Hendig.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">My boys,</q> Pike said, <q ab:speaker="Pike">you will
    be happy to know that we have just received a report from the laboratory,
    and, as I suspected, this venture will be well worth the
    expense. Therefore, we now shift into high gear.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Wait a moment,</q> Stringer said, pointing to
    Hendig. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That's fine. But you have never explained
    to me how this oaf is going to get us to your city.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Hendig growled. <q ab:speaker="Hendig">Navigator had charts and he
    disappeared on Hendig. I know where to find him or charts. We get them and
    then go to the city. Otherwise we have to find city by my memory.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer guessed what result that would bring. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And
    where is this navigator?</q> he said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig">He left us on Hendig's World.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Stringer laughed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And you expect him to be
    alive and waiting for us after twenty-odd years?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Hendig and I have gone over this before,</q> Pike
    said. <q ab:speaker="Pike">We will have to take that risk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And why should it be easier to get to this
    navigator than to the city itself?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig">Hendig does have a map of such area. It was first
    place we arrived, and duplicate charts were made. Hendig said he shall get
    you to that navigator, and so he shall.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">This oaf is only likely to get us killed,</q>
    Stringer said. Hendig was even more of an idiot than he thought if Hendig
    believed the tale he was telling.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hendig picked up a stool and hurled it at Stringer. Stringer ducked as it
    flew over him, crashing into the wall. Once again Stringer unsheathed his
    kalan against Hendig. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">This time, Hendig, my point
    will be placed where the decision is final.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike stepped between the two and faced Stringer. <q ab:speaker="Pike">You
    had better remember that Hendig is now a colleague of yours, and you will
    have to get along with him.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It would be easier to kill him now and save the
    extra fuel.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Stringer!</q> Pike cried. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I told
    you once before not to argue with me. Remember, I am your commander in this
    mission. Remember that.</q> Pike had raised both arms and they were shaking
    with rage.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Ahh,</q> Stringer muttered, and began walking to
    the door.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly Hendig bounded after him with raised fists, but he had only taken
    two steps before Valyavar strode forward and stopped him cold with one
    swift blow on the jaw.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer whirled around and glanced at Hendig, then at Valyavar. The two
    smiled broadly at each other and left the office together.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the remainder of the year left a moment to breathe, it was a moment as
    rare to the eye as a perfect sunset. Pike needed the year, not only to
    complete the preparations for the expedition but to place his vast
    financial holdings in good hands. And although Stringer was impatient to
    leave, he conceded that the delay had its advantages. He was now an expert
    pilot; Pike had made sure of that, if nothing else. To zoom down a runway
    five meters off the ground, scaring half the support crew out of their
    wits, was something at which Stringer was now brilliantly proficient, as
    well as at performing hair-raising acrobatics in any of a dozen types of
    aircraft.
  </p>

  <p>
    The swing-winged shuttles, light of molybdenum-iridium alloy, powered by
    hydrogen, and with sailplanelike glide ratios, were designed to cover
    distances on the scale of planets. Stringer thought he could take apart
    these planes and put them back together blindfolded now. And because they
    did fly like gliders, Stringer was trained in gliders too. He learned to
    fly in such a way as to conserve a maximum amount of fuel, and to fly in
    conditions where, if one's attention lapsed, the wings of the more
    expensive and irreplaceable shuttles could easily snap in two. Pike was not
    taking any chances. To that end, Stringer found himself becoming a fair
    electronics technician, a little harder than flying, and even learning some
    mathematics. That was the hardest.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he was flying the gliders, which Stringer viewed as an extravagant
    waste of time, and learning the mathematics, which he viewed as even less
    relevant to the journey, he occasionally thought it contradictory that Pike
    should spend so much exacting energy in preparing for every possible
    contingency while, at the same time, the entire expedition was being
    readied on the word of a liar and the evidence of one mysterious piece of
    metal. Stringer wondered if they were all fanatics. But he always managed
    to put the thought out of his mind within a moment and return to work.
  </p>

  <p>
    During that year, when Stringer did find those precious moments to breathe,
    he made sure that they were spent at least half a kilometer from Hendig. He
    was glad that Valyavar seemed to have sided with him, but even long after
    the incident in Pike's office, Valyavar spoke little and still not at all
    outside routine training matters. Stringer decided that he would probably
    never get to know the fellow, but shrugged this off immediately, deciding
    also that it probably mattered less than nothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    One evening, at the year's end, exhausted from overwork and yet working
    still, Stringer and Valyavar were down in the hangars, checking over the
    shuttlecraft that were soon to be sent up to the main ship in orbit. A
    technician called Valyavar over to the hangar office, saying that Pike
    wanted to talk to him over the phone. A few minutes later Valyavar
    returned.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Well, 'tseems that we're to be off in a
    week.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It's about time,</q> Stringer said. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Something has to give soon. I'm feeling totally
    punch-drunk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar leaned back against the shuttle's shiny hull. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">Tell me, if 'twouldn't make a difference, why to
    Hendig's World?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Why? Stringer thought. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">To get rich,</q> he replied
    aloud.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar screwed up his furry eyes and studied Stringer's face intently. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">No, that's why I'm going, 'tis. After traveling
    across all Two-Bit and her sisters, 'ts about time I'm rich. At least that
    will comfort the body—if not the immortal soul. You, not to be. If you were
    the richest man in all of Two-Bit and had every comfort and every woman,
    you'd still have your energy and you'd still have to go. That's clear,
    'tis, very clear.</q> He paused, stroked his amazing beard, and smacked his
    lips loudly. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I think</q>—another pause—<q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">that you are going to find God.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer couldn't help but laugh. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You're crazy,
    nonlinear. Why would I want to meet a god who was evil enough to create
    Two-Bit?</q>Stringer rested his hands on the latch of the shuttle and
    pulled on it absently. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Gods don't exist anyway, so
    there is no point in discussing it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Okay, we won't talk about it then. But I'll take a
    peldram of kob, my pistol, and my beard that someday you will find your
    religion and your God. Now…</q> Valyavar held his finger in the air,
    pointing skywards, and pulled a book out of his never-absent sack that was
    lying by the shuttle. The book had been carefully preserved, with inlays of
    rare jewels and white leatil. He held it up to Stringer for his inspection
    and continued speaking in his lowest voice, which emerged from a vast
    subterranean cavern concealed in the depths of his body. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">Can I interest you in this ancient and priceless
    edition of the Galan Codices? They are guaranteed to bring you spiritual
    comfort in times of distress.</q> Valyavar tilted his head slightly, and
    perhaps, just perhaps, the minutest trace of a smile crossed his lips.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer doubled over with laughter, holding his sides tightly with his
    arms in an attempt to prevent his entrails from spilling out over the
    ground. Many minutes passed before the last tears were wiped from his damp
    face and his natural green-tinted gray replaced the red flush on his
    cheeks. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You were a priest?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar's smile became a distinct frown for a brief moment. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">I was.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer began laughing all over again in his fatigue and then shouted
    hysterically, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">To Hendig's! For glory! For riches!
    For God—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">But remember,</q> Valyavar warned, <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">first dress warmly, then put your faith in God.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'll remember, surely,</q> Stringer laughed. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Now I think it is time for a very long rest.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    And with that, they were ready.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Three</div>First Mistakes</h2>

  <p>
    By the tightening of the skin on his forehead and the nervous rapping of
    his finger on the panel, Pike knew that he was disturbed. And that
    disturbed him even further. As commander, he was the first to be awakened
    from the net, after his bodily functions had been brought up to normal. He
    had exercised briefly and had opened the front panel.
  </p>

  <p>
    What it showed him was wrong. And was Hendig right? That, too, was
    disturbing. Basically, Pike finally admitted to himself, he didn't believe
    what he was seeing. He looked again at the two images on the screen. If not
    for the lower brightness, he would have accepted the fact that Hendig's
    World was a star. It was nearly half the size of its own sun. It was fifty
    times the diameter of Two-Bit. Hendig had only been off by a factor of two;
    not bad for Hendig. Pike tried to imagine Two-Bit placed next to it. A
    child next to a skyscraper, a marble next to a basketball. Fifty times the
    diameter of Two-Bit was farther than the distance from Two-Bit to its own
    moon. Pike wasn't aware that planets this big existed, but here it was.
  </p>

  <p>
    And it was not a pleasant sight, this monster of a planet; no, it was not
    pleasant. Yet Pike could not turn away; he could only watch. The thick
    white clouds below him were being stirred up from a giant cauldron. The
    violent activity should have been accompanied by thunderous, volcanic
    sounds, but the silence was complete, the tumultuous churning muted by the
    vacuum of space. Bits of blue broke through here and there, the slightest
    hints of peace in a turbulent atmosphere. Night fell toward the west. He
    could see but a little beyond the terminator. Mountains covered with snow?
    That was the only picture his mind could conjure up from the uneven flecks
    of white dotting the blackness. Pike shivered.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally he became too nervous and turned away to other business. Now that
    they had arrived safely, it was time to awaken the rest of the crew from
    their chemical hibernation in the net. Within a moment Pike had started the
    process that would soon release Hendig, Valyavar, and Stringer from the
    gelatin-filled wombs in which they had, along with himself, slept for so
    long. Stringer, seemingly content to remain asleep, was taking a bit longer
    to revive than Hendig and Valyavar, and the other two were well up and
    about before Stringer began to respond.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer, at this point, was aware of only one thing: that he felt
    terrible. That was the first thing he decided as his sore elbow, stiff
    neck, tingling toes, crusted-over eyelids, and aching buttocks informed him
    that he was being awakened from the net. If he had known that this was the
    way one was <em>supposed</em> to feel at that particular moment, perhaps he
    would have felt better. The images of Filldirt's body face down in a pool
    of blood, Hendig's enraged face, and a stained kalan in his hand finally
    began to fade as the light penetrated his eyes. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Stand
    up.</q> Stringer cocked his head, shook it violently to clear it, and stood
    up blinking his eyes. He fell back again. Ouch.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Don't you want to take a look, my friend?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    There was no need to ask who that was, as Pike's voice accosted his
    ears. Not really, Stringer told himself, concentrating on his sore back.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'd say it's the biggest planet under Transhi I ever
    saw. You really should take a look.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Ours to it is like a snallot to a craglark's
    back,</q> added a familiar basso profundo from the background. Stringer
    smiled but wrinkled his nose when he realized that he knew nothing of
    snallots—or of craglarks, either, for that matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And it's all ours, my friend, all ours.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Who cares?</q> Stringer mumbled, but managed to
    raise himself with a creak. He didn't think he could look at anything until
    his eyes could function properly. The light <em>was</em> very bright. But
    he walked to the window to take a glance, anyway.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was many moments before Stringer, as Pike earlier, moved a centimeter
    from the panel. Stringer, too, shivered.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What do you think?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It looks big.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">A fine poet you are.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I never confessed to that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer wanted to wash, even though he knew he couldn't be dirty after
    three years in the net. He turned away from the panel but could not help
    glancing back over his shoulder at the immense crescent filling the
    sky. Pike was leaning against the wall, observing him with a grin. Stringer
    gave him a slow eyeing and shook his head. Then he went to get himself
    something to eat.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    A day later and several million kilometers closer to the planet, Pike
    looked up from the console. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I don't hear anything, and
    I'm afraid I don't see much, either.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Did you expect to? We listened for a year, as per
    regulations, before we were allowed to come. If we had heard anything then,
    we wouldn't even have been allowed to take off. Why do you expect to hear
    anything now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No, my friend, I don't. But since officialdom frowns
    on accidental encounters, it is required that we check. And a positive
    result might have saved time. Now we must rely on our esteemed colleague
    Hendig's help.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Hendig had been sitting quietly all this time at the console, refreshing
    his memory with the details of his sole surviving chart from the previous
    voyage. Finally he stood up and showed the map to Pike. <q
    ab:speaker="Hendig">It was north, near a coast.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">There's a coast,</q> Stringer said, pointing to a
    vast expanse of blue painted next to a strip of brown that emerged from
    white clouds near the top of the panel.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">But is it north?</q> Valyavar asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig">It is if Hendig came this way,</q> Hendig said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">And what if he was upside down?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Look, my boys, the size of this planet is unexpected
    and will make discovery difficult. I suggest we get to work and see if we
    can pinpoint Hendig's landmass. Tell me, Hendig, how big an area does this
    map cover?</q> Pike asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hendig shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Hendig">More than Two-Bits. Maybe four
    bits.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Peanuts!</q> Stringer grumbled. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">A snallot to a craglark's back.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">We'll begin photographing the surface and see if we
    can identify Hendig's chart. That will save some time, don't you think?</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    It might have saved some time, but they were still at it a week later. The
    automatic cameras snapped thousands of photographs, and each was
    contour-fitted by the computer against Hendig's map for a possible
    location. The cloud cover was generally so thick that radar often gave more
    reliable results, but nothing came up positive. Finally, at the end of the
    week, Hendig was staring out a port at a small patch of the huge planet
    when he suddenly exclaimed, <q ab:speaker="Hendig">That's it! By Jedoval,
    I'd swear to it.</q> The other crew members clustered around the port as
    Hendig pointed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So much for our wonderful instrumentation.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Jedoval, the god of jokes. A fine one to swear
    by.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Are you certain that's the spot?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig">Do you doubt Hendig?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    There was no answer to that question. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well, then,</q>
    Pike said, <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'd say we should get a closer orbit and
    then be on our way.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Might it be to split up?</q> Valyavar asked. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">We still have a lot of ground to cover.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">A superb idea. We'll take two of the shuttles and
    travel in pairs.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer took one look at Hendig and Pike and sided with Valyavar. There
    were no arguments. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Valyavar and I will take
    <em>Number One</em>.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Many hours later, they had readied the ship for shutdown and turned all the
    life-support systems to standby. The four men walked into the elevator,
    which took them aft to the shuttle hangar. The four craft rested silently
    in their berths, waiting to be released. Their huge wings were swung close,
    folded to their sides, waiting for an atmosphere in which to function. The
    room echoed slightly, Stringer noticed. He remembered that he had noticed
    the same thing three years earlier. Three years. They had been the swiftest
    years of his life. He hadn't even noticed their passing, asleep in the net
    while the <em>Crimson</em>, propelling itself through space by the energy
    of suns, accelerated to near-light velocities, then slowed to rest once
    more. And, reflected Stringer, it was a good thing they had been cushioned
    in the womb of the net. The high acceleration would have been difficult to
    adjust to, but perhaps possible. Three years of boredom might have been
    coped with. But he was certain that the crew would not have survived the
    trip before they killed themselves off altogether. However, six years round
    trip was better than twenty years on Two-Bit, and Stringer almost laughed
    aloud when he realized that on his return all those left behind would have
    a minimum of fourteen extra years added to their lives. But he didn't laugh
    aloud, and silently crossed the hangar deck to open the hatch on <em>Number
    One</em> shuttlecraft.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Ts time to depart, I'll say,</q> said
    Valyavar. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">We know where we're about?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you know something,
    Valyavar?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">What's that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm a little scared.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Good for you. 'Tseems to me that's the usual rule,
    saints and maniacs excepted.</q> Valyavar pressed a button. The ramp opened
    below, taking <em>Number One</em> with it. The plane slide noiselessly away
    and left the mother ship behind.
  </p>

  <p>
    They were silent as Valyavar took the craft out of orbit. Nothing much
    seemed to be happening. Then Stringer began to understand how far they must
    still be from the planet. After a long while Stringer realized that the
    only thing he could see were white clouds. After another long while—hours?
    days?—they were immersed in them. Stringer's breath now came in quicker
    gasps. He looked rapidly in all directions and saw nothing but white.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">It's being blind with your eyes open, yuh?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded. He could see only the haze swirling around him, not quite
    solid. Each moment became unbearably longer, until Stringer was on the
    point of screaming. And then the clouds broke. Reflexively, Stringer jumped
    back in his seat, and Valyavar pulled up on the controls. Hendig's World
    lay beneath them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar had done an expert job of finding the coast. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Well done,</q> Stringer said as he surveyed the vast
    expanse of blue that stretched flat to the horizon.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">A little help from the radar isn't to be
    denied.</q> Valyavar smiled as he glanced to the left and saw land. The
    coastal area was thickly green, but in the distance—
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike" ab:filter="radio">Look at those mountains!</q> Pike's
    voice boomed over the radio, signaling their arrival.
  </p>

  <p>
    Running parallel to their course of flight were mountains. It was difficult
    to judge their height or distance. Valyavar was sure they were not far and
    not tall, but Stringer disagreed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We can't see beyond them and look at our
    altitude. They must be tens of kilometers high.</q> Stringer took a range
    fix and confirmed his suspicions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Is it to north?</q> Valyavar called to <em>Number
    Two</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig" ab:filter="radio">Yes. It is hit right on the thumb,</q> Hendig
    replied. <q ab:speaker="Hendig" ab:filter="radio">You'll be sorry you doubted Hendig yet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">To north, then,</q> Valyavar muttered, <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">but it could be forever.</q> Despite the gloomy
    forecast, Valyavar was smiling and excited. Stringer scowled and took a
    berth for the first shift.
  </p>

  <p>
    They flew up the coast for hours, one sleeping, if he could, while the
    other sat at the controls. Although Stringer knew they were traveling at
    hypersonic speeds, the planetscape changed only slowly.
  </p>

  <p>
    The radio blared again. It was Pike. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Though it is
    difficult to say at this altitude, the atmosphere seems normal, though very
    dense for this height, and a little high on the trace elements, especially
    helium.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You're sounding professional,</q> Stringer said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike" ab:filter="radio">I can read a printout as well as the
    next man. It means, no doubt, that we can breathe, and that's all I'm
    interested in—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig" ab:filter="radio">I breathed last time I was
    here,</q> Hendig said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike" ab:filter="radio">—but let us be sure to check on the
    ground, shall we?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Okay,</q> Stringer mumbled, flipping off the
    set. More hours went by, with only the faint whistle of the wind as it sped
    past the hull to keep them company. More hours went by, with only the faint
    whistle of the wind as it sped past the hull to keep them company. Stringer
    was standing in the cockpit behind Valyavar, getting something to eat, when
    Valyavar shouted and the radio blared simultaneously.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig" ab:filter="radio">Ahead on the coast!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Do you see it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig" ab:filter="radio">Look at that clearing inland!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It's a city!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Clearly it was. Valyavar dove in for a closer view. The ground became a
    blur of green and brown, indistinguishable. The city was behind them. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">To take another look?</q> He pulled back on the
    controls and they circled in a wide arc over the ocean. This time they
    could see the settlement more clearly. Yes, settlement it was. No towering
    buildings or great monuments. The structures were low, arranged along a
    hillside, and blended in with the surroundings.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig" ab:filter="radio">So Hendig has found it,</q> came
    the gruff voice over the radio.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly Stringer and Valyavar saw <em>Number Two</em> turn inland and
    begin speeding straight for the mountains.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Where are you going?</q> Stringer shouted.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig" ab:filter="radio">To pay a visit,</q> Hendig
    replied. <q ab:speaker="Hendig" ab:filter="radio">The quickest way to find
    the city we came for is to find a certain colleague of Hendig's who may be
    here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That stranded navigator? Oh, come on.</q> Stringer
    turned to Valyavar and whispered in his ear, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">He's
    out of his mind.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike must have overheard. <q ab:speaker="Pike" ab:filter="radio">Don't
    worry, my boys, I suggest you proceed north while I take a slight detour to
    check this out. After all, our Hendig has been accurate so far.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, the hell with them.</q> Stringer shut down
    the radio.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Come, let's get on,</q> Valyavar said. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">It will save some time, mayhaps, and help us find
    what we've come for.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer remained silent.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You don't understand?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Marauders always have to be first. You've not been
    trained to be a pilot, nor an aeronautical engineer, but 'tseems to me, a
    marauder. So 'tis time to act like one.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No. You'd think that
    after a year of preparation we would have come prepared. But we
    didn't. We're expert pilots, fighters, can operate spacecraft, computers,
    anything, but we don't have the faintest idea of what we're doing. Knowing
    Hendig, that city could be anywhere on this planet. We could be here for
    decades. A fine bunch of marauders we've turned out to be.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You don't have the right spirit. Look at Pike to
    example—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">He knows what he wants, that man. He just plunges
    in, reckless. Look at him going off with Hendig just like that. But he
    knows he'll win, too. He won't leave Hendig's World without something.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">When you fight with the kalan, any observer would
    think that you're the most reckless killer on Two-Bit. Where is that spirit
    now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That's different.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">How so?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer's eyes gleamed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">There's nothing
    <em>really</em> at stake here. When something's at stake, then there's the
    tension. That's when I feel finely tuned. With a kalan in my hand I am
    relaxed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar sighed and shook his great bearded head. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">Indeed, it is difficult to distinguish between saints
    and maniacs.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You <em>were</em> a priest. Why?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar shrugged his huge shoulders. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Tseems to
    me I wanted to find God.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Any success?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Absolutely none. God may be interested in truth
    but isn't in a hurry to admit it, that's for certain. If such a thing as
    truth exists, trying to find it through God will only lead to indigestion
    with every sermon. 'Tseems to me that the sum of all religion is that the
    lovers of God are the haters of men. Man is more interesting to man,
    'tseems to me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And yet you've charged me with finding God,
    huh?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar grinned. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I thought you needed something
    to do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer laughed. He liked Valyavar.
  </p>

  <p>
    They changed controls and continued flying up the coast. Within a few hours
    word came from Pike. <q ab:speaker="Pike" ab:filter="radio">Things are fine
    at this end. Keep exploring. I'll call you back when I need you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shrugged at the lack of content in the message and paid attention
    to his piloting. As the hours went by he became half-consciously aware that
    the coast was becoming less densely green and was curving to the
    east. Although their altitude was above twenty kilometers, where no weather
    would be experienced on Two-Bit, the frequent tug on the controls told
    Stringer that Hendig's World had a lot of air on it, and moving air at
    that.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mountain range that had been following their path gradually withered to
    foothills and then dropped away altogether. They changed controls numerous
    times, taking turns sleeping. This time, however, Stringer could not
    sleep. He tossed in his berth, told himself to stand up, and returned to
    the cockpit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Anything?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Hills, water, lots of haze. Can't see the ground
    too well sometimes. 'Tis a planet all right, even if it is too big to be
    believed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The light from the sun was entering the right window and heating up the
    cabin. Stringer squinted. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How long have we been
    up?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Let's see here. About sixty hours.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Has it been light all that time?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">To be sure, little Stringer, awfully bright.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer reflected. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It's a long day on Hendig's
    World.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Very long indeed. We've come about one hundred
    thousand kilometers from where we left Pike.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">One hundred thousand! Has Pike called?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Not since the first.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We're stupid. Marauders or not, we should have
    turned around long ago. Do we have enough fuel to get back?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I've been mindful. And we have his beacon. No
    problem to worry your head, little Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't care, we should have turned around.</q>
    Stringer wasn't sure if he was concerned about Pike or Hendig, but he did
    think it a good idea to fly back. He did not have much time to think,
    however. It was merely a flash in the corner of his eye, but it was
    enough. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Did you see it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">This one's ours, I'd say!</q> Valyavar cried, and
    he put the craft into a steep dive. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Krek tu
    Dai!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Hold on!</q> Stringer shouted as he was pushed
    back into his seat with a jerk. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you think
    you're doing?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Don't go nonlinear. Remember, you're Bitter.</q>
    Valyavar continued the downward plummet in apparent glee.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Pull up! Are you trying to get us killed?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Something's at stake here. You should feel
    relaxed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Only when the stick's in my hand.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar pulled into a shallower dive several kilometers above the
    ground. The plane responded instantly and the ground leveled.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wind. Stringer's head hit the ceiling with a jolt. His head reeled and
    he grabbed for his own set of controls. Again the craft bucked and Stringer
    was afraid that the wings might snap off. Valyavar fought with the
    controls, trying to make amends for his marauder's enthusiasm. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">One draft down there to make Sarek wince. When he
    made Two-Bit, he couldn't have had more malice than this wind.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Get it down!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar tried to slow the plane and headed in for a clearing near the
    shore. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">It's to be tight, no question.</q> The
    shuttle shook again. The clearing was now almost right under them.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Watch the cliff there! On the left! You'll hit the
    wing.</q> Stringer gritted his teeth as he saw the hill rising next to him
    with an eastern face of bare rock.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Yes, it's to be tight. We can't slow enough for a
    vertical.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    This time Stringer squeezed his eyes shut.
  </p>

  <p>
    The giant nudged the plane forward, slowing it as much as he dared. By this
    time he was closing in on the tree tops. <em>Number One</em> was now
    sinking into the clearing.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Jedoval help us—</q> Stringer said, forcing a
    smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Remember, first dress warmly—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">—then rely on God, I know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The turbulent wind struck again. Valyavar was not prepared for the violent
    shove. <em>Number One</em> smashed into the cliff, little more than ten
    meters above the ground. But it hit hard, the left wing crumbled and broke
    off.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer grabbed his seat as the plane slid down the rock wall with a
    horrifying screech and crashed into the ground.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Four</div>Introductions for Planet
  and Explorer I</h2>

  <p>
    When Hendig had first turned <em>Number Two</em> shuttlecraft inland,
    Pike's initial reaction was one of amused curiosity. After all, even if the
    odds of finding this mythical navigator alive after twenty years were one
    in a million, Hendig, for all his dubious reasoning, had so far been
    surprisingly accurate in his predictions. Accurate enough, that is, so that
    Pike began to wonder if, in fact, he knew what he was doing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within a few minutes of flying time, the mountain range loomed large and
    blotted out the western sky. Hendig turned parallel to the range, flew
    north, then south again. After several sweeps he slowed the plane and
    nudged Pike. <q ab:speaker="Hendig">Look there.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike strained his eyes as Hendig pushed the button that froze the
    video. High up on the mountain rested a village whose buildings were
    colored only a little differently from the mountain itself and set into the
    rock.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Are you telling me that's where we're going? How are
    we supposed to land?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig">No, it's just a landmark. That village is
    deserted. But look here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike's eyes followed Hendig's finger to the altimeter, and he didn't like
    what he saw. <q ab:speaker="Pike">How could they live up there? It's eight
    or nine kilometers at least.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Hendig shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Hendig">My bronze is not to explain those
    things. Now Hendig takes us down.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike watched with relief as the altimeter dropped several kilometers as
    they descended through a new layer of clouds. The airspeed indicator was
    slowing, and after a moment more of flying south, Hendig pointed out the
    cockpit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig">Massarat ahead. We can land on the plateau.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike saw the plateau and the cleft simultaneously. It took him a few more
    moments to pick out the buildings. As if a giant had cut a shelf into the
    mountain, the plateau extended outward from the range until it abruptly
    terminated in a drop of at least a hundred meters before the mountain's
    outward slip caught it once again. On the inner edge of the plateau, into
    the mountain itself, was cut a giant gorge running almost due west and
    losing itself in the shadows. The city: clusters of buildings hanging
    precariously on the side of the cleft, others built on the plateau, and
    still more cut into the mountain face. Even as the plane began settling,
    Pike could see the giant staircase hewn out of rock that led from the
    plateau to an unseen termination within the gorge. A strange place to eke
    out an existence, he thought.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Number Two</em> was almost at a dead standstill now, hovering above the
    plain. The dust sprayed up by the engines obscured their vision below. Pike
    heard a soft thump and knew they were on the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    Immediately Hendig walked back to the weapons cabinet and began arming
    himself with knife and graser. <q ab:speaker="Hendig">Hendig may not be
    wanted here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike, thinking there was more to this than met the eye, followed suit,
    strapping a holster across his chest. He stepped to the hatch, unlocked it,
    swung the door wide, and jumped out.
  </p>

  <p>
    A blast of hot, damp air hit him in the face at the same time that a great
    whirring sound struck his ears. The crowd was already growing as Pike
    stepped away from the hull. People ran across the plain toward the shuttle,
    others climbed down from their cliff dwellings, and more emerged from the
    darkness in the cleft. The whirring grew louder and louder. Were they
    making this sound?
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Hendig">We're safe,</q> shouted Hendig from behind him, over
    the rising pulsations. <q ab:speaker="Hendig">This sound is good.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now the crowd was upon them, and they were surrounded on three sides by
    people who, at first glance, might have been mistaken for humans. Suddenly,
    within a moment, the sound level died away, suddenly enough so Pike thought
    something was wrong. He stood there, rigid, watching the crowd part in
    peristaltic waves. The center of the disturbance could only be the
    wide-brimmed hat floating toward them above the sea of hands. Finally,
    after endless moments of expectation, the nearest spectators shuffled
    aside, and a gaunt, weatherbeaten man, who at once reminded Pike of a bird,
    stepped forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike turned toward Hendig and saw that he held his graser outstretched,
    pointed at the newcomer. The silence was complete but for the intrusion of
    the wind that whistled through the gorge, showering dust upon them all, and
    for the intense hatred that arced across the space between the two
    men. Pike immediately convinced himself of the reality of the hatred. This
    was not a superficial hatred such as that which Stringer bore for Hendig,
    whom he regarded as no more than an oaf and a braggart, but a hatred that
    had been carefully nursed and stoked for over two decades by a man who had
    nothing but memories of a life that might have been.
  </p>

  <p>
    A moment later Pike was wondering if his analysis was correct because he
    saw Hendig lower his graser when the newcomer appeared to be unarmed, and
    even begin laughing. <q ab:speaker="Hendig">Look at this.</q> Hendig
    pointed. <q ab:speaker="Hendig">Look at this.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The other man stepped up to Hendig with a wide grin on his lips, wide
    enough so that Pike thought it would split his face in two. But it was a
    skewed grin, cockeyed, only a poor approximation of pleasure. The two men
    were now face to face, staring one another in the eyes. Suddenly, the
    newcomer grasped Hendig's graser arm, simultaneously pulled out a knife
    which he had held concealed, and thrust it through Hendig's neck. There was
    not the time for Pike to react; there was not even the time for Hendig to
    frown, and with his laugh still frozen on his lips, he slumped to the
    dust-covered rock of the plateau.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now the stranger began to shake convulsively from head to toe. He stared
    blankly at the body for a long time and then at Pike without saying a word,
    only shaking.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike knelt by Hendig and confirmed the absence of a pulse. Pike screwed up
    his lips and worried for a long moment that this unfortunate incident might
    bring the mission to a premature termination. Then the obvious occurred to
    him: the newcomer was, in all probability, the navigator for which they had
    come. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Now, my good man, why don't you tell me who you
    are?</q> he asked, thinking the question an eminently reasonable way to
    find out.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stranger started, sighed, then suddenly regained total composure. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Now that seems like a reasonable thing to ask. The
    name is Paddelack.</q> He held out his hand, palm up, in the Bitter
    fashion, but Pike was too startled by the sudden change of bearing to
    respond. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">And who are you, my gaping friend?</q>
    Paddelack asked. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I'd suggest you close that mouth
    of yours instead of leaving it open for the sting flies to populate.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike clamped his mouth shut. He wasn't sure about this Paddelack fellow; he
    talked too much like himself. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Pike, the name is
    Pike.…Tell me, Paddelack, did I detect some antipathy between you and Master
    Hendig?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Antipathy? Why use fancy words when simple ones
    will do? Hate, pure distilled hate is what it is. Nothing fancier than
    that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike was at least glad to learn his initial observation had been
    accurate. <q ab:speaker="Pike">And although I gather that you were once
    navigator for my colleague, why don't you explain the cause of this falling
    out.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack's response was forestalled by the arrival of mats and containers
    of food brought by the cliff dwellers. The entire settlement seemed to
    burst into celebration and the noise was deafening. Paddelack motioned for
    Pike to sit down as a young creature proffered food.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack said something to the child in a totally alien language, then
    spoke to Pike directly. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">This is my friend
    Mith.</q> Pike didn't hear what Paddelack had said because he now noticed
    that aside from the very dark and leathery skin, the child also had six
    fingers on his hands, two of which may have been opposable thumbs. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">I see you are surprised at how human they look. So
    was I. But then I found out the differences. You'll find out if you are
    idiotic enough to stay here that long.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike leaned back in the shade of the shuttlecraft. It was very hot, in fact
    hotter than any time or place he could remember. <q ab:speaker="Pike">But
    back to your story, please,</q> he said, speaking over the background
    noise. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Please tell me how you came to this place that
    would have the crabs screaming for mercy.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack spat on the ground and waved a finger at Hendig's body. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">When I ran into that renegade, he souped up some
    story that he was contracted with Two-Bit Transportation to do some
    prospecting. Said he was making a run to Barythron because some astrometric
    evidence showed that something peculiar was going on. Imagine he wasn't
    working by the books just running off like that, doubt he had a contract at
    all—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Correct.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack" class="no-close-quote">Anyway, I hopped on as
    engineer, navigator, whatever. I pretty much flopped as an engineer, never
    even got halfway through school. But nine out of ten men are suicides,
    anyway, so it doesn't bother me too much. Certainly didn't bother that
    idiot.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack" class="no-close-quote">Trip took about three years,
    proper time. Woke up, and what did we see? Strangest planetary system I've
    ever heard of. Just the sun and this giant, six hundred thousand kilometers
    across if it's a centimeter. The only other thing is a little ball of rock,
    half the size of Two-Bit and half as far out. What it's doing here I don't
    know. What this monster is doing here I don't know, either. Something's
    mighty peculiar, although I've never been able to test my suspicions,
    sitting up here on this mountain.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Anyway, we impacted down here, right into the
    soup, to see what we could see. Didn't find much, that's for sure. No
    evidence of anything except the usual metals. So we about gave up. Then we
    found the city. <q>Daryephna,</q> they call it in these parts. Such a sweet
    sound for <q>Palace of Fear</q>—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">But Hendig told me the natives didn't know anything
    about it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack glanced again at the body and began chewing on some tough
    food. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack" class="no-close-quote">Listening to him was like
    listening to a random-number generator; anything came out of his mouth.…Oh,
    the natives knew something about it, or about something. It's not clear
    what they knew, how they knew it, be it by myth or Polkraitz legend, but
    they knew something. None of them had ever been there, as it's across the
    ocean. And what an ocean! At least 150k kilometers across from here, if not
    more.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack" class="no-close-quote">So we went over to the
    city. Even from orbit it was magnificent. Well, now that I think about it,
    it could have been ugly, depending on your tastes. May as well have been a
    sculpture.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">We didn't find too much and never discovered the
    purpose of most of that. I couldn't quite tell if the place had been
    cleaned out or if no one had ever been there before. Like a newly built
    home. Who's to say if someone is moving out or in? But Hendig found
    something; he showed me a piece of it. I never saw exactly where it came
    from in that city, because he picked me to come here to recruit some
    natives to help cart the stuff out. They were willing enough to help,
    probably because they could hardly understand what we wanted them to
    do. But after we got to Daryephna, the Fear started to set in. I don't know
    exactly what it was—never felt it myself. All I know is that shortly after
    we got them in, there was quite a riot. Several people were killed. Hendig,
    who swore by Jedoval, though you'd think he was reared by Sarek, sent me to
    bring them back. But a storm blew up just as we were landing on the coast
    of Liddlefur.…You've never seen a storm like the ones we get here. It's a
    bit too early in the day for them, but that sun picks up a lot of water,
    and it's got to come down sometime. So my plane crashed. Hendig never
    bothered to come and find me. Maybe the Fear finally got him too. Most
    likely he was afraid that the natives would rip him to shreds after what
    happened at Daryephna. But soon it was too late anyway; the Freeze started
    to set in. You know they call this planet Freeze-Bake. It certainly is the
    most appropriate name for it I can think of. So, here I have been for more
    than twenty years, almost a native by this time.</q> Paddelack finished
    with a shiver and stared inwardly at himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I suppose I can understand your feelings for
    Hendig,</q> said Pike. <q ab:speaker="Pike">It is difficult to blame you
    for killing him.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack just stared at the ground. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I…didn't
    know what to do. There he was, after twenty years. He left me here but now
    he was my way off. I didn't know what to do. And then my body did it, by
    itself, my whole body.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well, you're forgiven. Tell me, what happened to the
    charts?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack's attention was distracted by Mith's insistent tugging at his
    shoulder. He glanced in the direction the child was motioning and his eyes
    widened. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Gostum again,</q> he said as he pointed
    out to Pike several intruders riding through the cleft atop tall, muscular
    animals whose long hairs draped over the riders' legs. They were dressed
    in, of all things, black, and had a single orange stripe crossing their
    chests. As they drew nearer the noise level abated and the festivities
    ground to a halt. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What do they want this
    time?</q> Paddelack asked himself. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">More food?
    Supplies? Parasites.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Who are they?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Untrusted neighbors. Whatever they want, you can
    be sure your presence is now noted for future reference.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The riders were soon off without any disturbance and the celebrations
    continued as if never interrupted. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Back to the charts,
    please,</q> Pike insisted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack laughed. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Lost in the crash, of
    course.…Now, if you're smart, you'll get off this planet as soon as you
    can. I don't care how bizarre it is; it's not worth your staying on.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike shook his head resolutely. <q ab:speaker="Pike">No. I am afraid we
    didn't come here just to rescue you, and I won't go until I get to that
    city.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Paddelack began shaking again, as he had when he faced off
    Hendig. Suddenly he shot himself at Pike and shook him violently by the
    shoulders. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You must promise to get me off this
    planet! I'll do anything you want! I'll follow you anywhere! But you must
    promised to get me off as soon as you can!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike gently took Paddelack's hands away from his neck. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Stop it. Stop it.</q> Paddelack fell back onto the mat,
    still racked with sobs. The crowd around them stared curiously. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, of course. You're as good as off. Stick with me and
    you'll be away from Freeze-Dried, or whatever you called it, as soon as I
    am. Now, why don't you tell me why this place is so unbearable? It might be
    good information to have.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack picked up a pick of a leathery-looking vegetable and offered some
    to Pike. Pike refused; Mith grabbed it and ran off into the surrounding
    crowd.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I wouldn't worry about them,</q> Paddelack said,
    running a hand through his closely cropped gray hair. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">They're the friendliest bunch I've ever met. It's
    their society that does it, I think. It's not they who should worry you,
    but this planet itself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">It seems rather big, somewhat damp, and
    extraordinarily hot, but I think one might adjust to it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Hah!</q> Paddelack snorted. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">So you've noticed it's <q>somewhat damp</q> and
    <q>extraordinarily hot</q> up here. Well, then, think of what it's like
    down there—</q> Paddelack pointed in the direction of the coast. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Oh, yes, we live up here in the mountains mostly
    because it's <q>pleasant.</q> But what about when you want to eat? Then
    there's the two-hundred-kilometer trek to the coast for some fish, through
    the slimiest, sweatiest jungle you've ever seen that will, as likely as
    not, kill you before you get there. But I shouldn't complain too
    much. Tomorrow will be much hotter. This is the shortest day, and except in
    the middle two months or less, we can get down to the coast without serious
    loss of life. Around midyear it's impossible. Makes me wish for
    nighttime. Right now there's only a skeleton crew down at Liddlefur—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'm not following you, Paddelack. Will you slow down?
    Tell me again why you don't live at the coast.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I told you, it's too hot there in the middle of
    the day. Next year, tomorrow, it will be too hot to go down there at all,
    except for the very beginning and end of the day. So we stay up here,
    getting ready for night. After all, night starts in a couple of months, and
    we get ready for it early so there won't be any foul-ups. You don't want
    foul-ups on Freeze-Bake.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike shook his head and asked for some water. <q ab:speaker="Pike">What do
    you mean, <q>night starts in a couple of months</q>? What do you mean,
    <q>today is the shortest day</q>? Is it winter?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">In a way,</q> Paddelack replied, cocking his head
    and pinching his nose. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You really don't
    understand, do you? Well, turn around and look at that sun.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike, indeed, could hardly make out the yellow ball weaving its way between
    clouds.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Have you seen that sun move since you showed
    up?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I haven't been watching.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Well, sir explorer, take a guess why it is so hot
    down here. Never mind, I'll answer that. The sun takes so long to move,
    that's why, pure and simple. It greenhouses awful down here. I mean, they
    used to tell me that ground equilibrates pretty fast and won't get much
    hotter if you heat it for a month rather than a day, but the
    greenhouse—that's what really does it. Those clouds trap a lot of
    heat. Directly beneath that sun it may shoot up to several hundred, for all
    I know. But that's only half the story. When that sun goes down, it stays
    down for more than six of your lousy Two-Bit months. First the rains come
    when it starts getting cool enough for this supersaturated atmosphere to
    begin dumping its horde. Then the winds come, winds that make a Bitter
    hurricane look like a dust devil. And by the time the winds stop, the sun
    is long gone. And by then it's gotten real cold. Nobody can talk about it
    much, because anyone who has so little of a brain to go out at night dies
    within seconds if he isn't dressed to the hilt. Even then you might have an
    hour. Even then I imagine you can't see anything but what the stars
    permit—if the stars exist any more. Haven't seen one in years! Been told the
    oceans freeze down to who knows how far, but they do freeze, that I can
    tell you, and legend even has the air freezing out on occasion. Now you
    understand why I—and everyone else on this Godforsaken planet—am a fanatic
    about wanting to get off.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    For perhaps the first time in his life, Pike was silenced for more than a
    complete second, but he soon recovered. <q ab:speaker="Pike">So where can
    you live at night?</q> he asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">In the mountains.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">How can that help?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Hot air rises, remember.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">It gets that cold?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Colder than that; we live underground.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike shook his head and fell silent once more.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Oh, you have no idea how much that slow, slow
    rotation period affects every little bit of life on this planet. Try
    explaining to these people the difference between a day and a year. It just
    doesn't click in their heads, not quite. We divide up our year, one
    revolution around the sun, into months and days and base our calendar on
    that. But what if your day is a year long? Then what do you do? Especially
    if you don't have a moon. The calendar becomes almost arbitrary. Here they
    happen to count in twelves: twelve teclads to a full <q>day</q> or
    <q>year,</q> which makes a teclad something over a month. Twelve beclads to
    a teclad, so a beclad is about three of our days. One beclad is one hundred
    forty-four telclads, making a telclad about half an hour. Each telclad is
    twelve belclads, so a belclad is about two minutes. There are one hundred
    forty-four clads to a belclad, giving very nearly a second for a clad. Just
    remember the prefixes and you'll stay confused. I trust I make myself
    obscure.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Look, give me something to write with.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike, not understanding exactly what Paddelack was up to, fished a
    never-absent note pad and stylus from his belt and handed them over.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack began writing. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">These values are only
    approximate and not to be taken as God's word. Here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike glanced at the paper and saw:
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr><td>1 clad</td><td>———</td><td>1 second</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1 belclad</td><td>———</td><td>2 minutes +</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1 telclad</td><td>———</td><td>30 minutes −</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1 beclad</td><td>———</td><td>3 days −</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1 telclad</td><td>———</td><td>1 month +</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What am I going to do with this?</q> he asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You'll need it if you're fool enough to stay here
    any longer,</q> said Paddelack. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Look, what I was
    trying to tell you is that there is incredibly little external basis for
    their calendar here. They seem to have an internal cycle, inherited from
    their original planet, no doubt, which makes the beclad a natural
    period. But that doesn't mean day to them at all. When you say <q>day</q>
    you are implying a relationship that doesn't exist here. Day tells you when
    to get up and go to bed and when it's dark and light. That's a year
    here. You get up and go to bed on your own. Not only that, but we expect
    that after a year, everything starts over again the way it was: stars,
    calendar, seasons, everything. Stars. Do they exist? Seasons? They're
    buried under the days. Seven days before everything starts over
    again. Seven cockeyed days of varying lengths. Is that seven seasons? If
    so, I suppose that means this planet must be tilted to produce such an
    insane effect. I don't know. Don't you understand?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike was getting very confused. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'm afraid I will just
    have to see for myself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You will if you are stupid enough to stay here
    another clad. I was hoping my little talk would have dissuaded you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No,</q> Pike said crumbling up the table Paddelack had
    written, <q ab:speaker="Pike">I am afraid I am going to Daryephna
    first.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Ahh, idiot.</q> Paddelack got up then.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike couldn't help staring at this man. He was a peculiar sight. Though he
    must have been around fifty, owing to the time dilations involved in
    getting to and from Hendig's Freeze-Baked planet, and his hair was gray and
    his skin worn, Paddelack's taut muscles and bony frame were plainly visible
    through the featureless suit that covered his entire body save for his
    hands and his face.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Don't you get hot in that thing?</q> Pike asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack laughed. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Insulation. Made from
    plants. Protects you from the heat. Also sort of a natural desiccant. Dry
    it out over some coals and it will suck up a lot of water—your sweat. You
    see, down below the mountain, it's too humid for you to sweat freely. Your
    pores get clogged, your skin infected, and you rot. So you wear a
    diaper—all over. Of course, you don't want to suck up the atmosphere, too,
    so the outer surface is waxy with enough holes to breathe. You have to be
    zero-defects on Freeze-Bake or you don't survive. These suits aren't
    strictly necessary up here but they help you from getting too burned.…Now,
    let's join the celebration of your arrival.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The natives were in a festive mood, exactly why Pike never found out. The
    pulsating roar that had greeted him and Hendig upon their arrival had
    hardly abated since. Dancing, singing, playing, all at once struck Pike as
    contradictory to the environment Paddelack had described. The Liddlefurans,
    named for the city on the coast, were fascinated by Pike's sidearms and
    amazed when he blasted away a boulder from the edge of the plateau to help
    clear a new path for them. They insisted that Pike take them for shuttle
    rides, and he obliged, giving each group a quick trip to the coast and
    back.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Well,</q> Paddelack said after half a dozen
    trips. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You're a hero. Enjoy it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I will. Of that you can be assured.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, after hours, Pike sought out Paddelack to ask him if they could
    put a halt to the merriment. Just as he approached the older man, Paddelack
    glanced into the gorge.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Gostum! Back again! This can't be good.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike saw a dozen men and women galloping through the cleft, scattering the
    crowd in all directions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I told you your presence would be noted. I
    suggest you use that graser of yours, and use it well.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike drew his graser, took quick aim, and fired at the nearest rider. The
    Gostum fell, but Pike didn't have time to fire again. He stood up quickly
    and just as quickly saw a flash in the hands of a second rider, a whiz
    through the air, and a wound open on his arm. He looked pleadingly toward
    Paddelack, whose arm was in the midst of hurling a knife. But the hand
    jerked backward just before release and the knife clattered to the ground,
    far short of its target. Pike felt dizzy and tumbled toward the ground. He
    did not see what happened to Paddelack, nor did he expect to see him again.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Five</div>Introductions for Planet
  and Explorer II</h2>

  <p>
    Stringer couldn't remember exactly when he had first realized he was still
    alive. The first thoughts were slow in crossing that nebulous dividing line
    between the unconscious and the aware. They were simple thoughts, direct
    verbalizations of feelings: the ground was hard; there was a great pain in
    his leg. And it was hot. Did he have a fever? After a few seconds Stringer
    had convinced himself that he did not have a fever, but he had convinced
    himself that it was indeed very hot.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer turned toward his right hand. It was resting on a clump of
    moss. No, it was not moss. It felt like moss but looked liked miniature
    ferns, only a few centimeters long and almost completely unfurled.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar was gone. The thought hit him suddenly and he jerked himself
    aright, only to scream aloud as the pain shot up from his leg. Now he saw
    the blood staining his brown pant leg. Broken. He looked again to his right
    and saw a brief message scrawled into the hard dirt: <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">Remember, the road to God is a lonely one and perhaps
    never-ending.</q> Stringer managed a slight smile but didn't like the
    implication of the message with blood trailing off the last
    letters. Clearly Val was dead, the great priest who had somewhere lost his
    face and found it again somewhere else. Val, the one and only. But where
    was the body? Stringer glanced toward <em>Number One</em> on his left. It
    lay at the base of the cliff, cockeyed, skewed over toward him. Had he been
    thrown clear? That didn't seem likely. The only thing that was clear was
    that he was alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer wondered if he was brave enough to kill himself. He couldn't move,
    and the heat would kill him sooner or later, anyway. There was the sun
    again. It really was not very high in the sky, barely flirting with the
    treetops. As far as he could tell, it looked about where he had left it, so
    he couldn't have been unconscious very long. But then he remembered the
    sixty-hour trip up the coast, when the sun had deceived them by hanging
    motionless in the sky. Maybe it had moved. Stringer couldn't make up his
    mind and succeeded in confusing himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    It didn't matter. The question was whether or not he should kill
    himself. The wind was hot over Stringer's face; the breeze caused a
    continual rustling of the trees. Were they trees? Tall, yes. The only
    leaves were at the top, wide, fanning outward like palm leaves. But each
    tree had three trunks. The leaves sat upon the middle one, and surrounding
    that central trunk were two others, hollowed like canoes, as if the tree
    had sprung out of a giant pod and the pod had grown up with the tree.
  </p>

  <p>
    But should he kill himself? The conflict was between a vague interest in
    exploring his surroundings and the conviction that Pike would not find him
    before he died, anyway. The sweat rolled freely off Stringer's forehead and
    he reached for his graser, strapped, as always, across his chest. It would
    be very painless, he thought. Who would care, anyway? Certainly not he.
  </p>

  <p>
    A pair of arms suddenly grasped him around the shoulders. It was not
    Valyavar. The graser in Stringer's hand streaked upward and fired.
  </p>

  <p>
    Five men and three women, dark in skin like the body lying next to him,
    stood around Stringer; wide-eyed, they began to back away in an enlarging
    circle. Stringer's left hand lay in a growing pool of blood issuing from
    the still figure beside him. The woman was quite dead. A thud off to the
    right brought his eyes to rest on an opening hand. A makeshift stretcher
    fell to the ground. The stretcher…the stretcher…
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer remembered the fight in Elswer's and how easy that had been. He
    remembered the shooting gallery and the little balls and how easy that had
    been. He reflected on his speed, which was unequaled by anyone. Then he
    glanced at the body next to him and realized that this time, perhaps for
    the first time, he had acted too quickly. I'm dead now, he thought, but
    it's what I had planned, anyway. As he thought those words the interest to
    explore his surroundings became suddenly greater, and he realized, too,
    that his wish to kill himself had passed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The strangers were now backed off to the edge of the clearing, talking
    among themselves. Stringer was surprised by only two things: the delay in
    action and their looking so human. He looked at the gun in his hand, sat up
    with a struggle, and flung the pistol several meters in their
    direction. When the others saw Stringer fling the gun, they jumped back
    again. Couldn't they see he wasn't going to hurt them?
  </p>

  <p>
    All Stringer could do was sigh as a gray-clad figure ran off through the
    woods. After about half an hour he heard more voices approaching. Not less
    than thirty people gathered around him now. When one of the original group
    came closer, Stringer pointed to his leg. The man seemed to understand and
    went about splinting the bone. A woman approached, also one of the original
    group, circled around, touched him gingerly as if he were red-hot, then
    signaled to the others when she was not burned.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was lifted onto the stretcher. Off they went through the
    woods. The sunlight filtered easily through the trees and provided a
    continual variation of light and dark on the backs of his porters. Stringer
    looked closely at the suits they were wearing. They were thick and shone
    dully. Leather flasks, two per person and slung from their shoulders,
    bounced on their flanks with each step. The cowl they all wore looked funny
    to Stringer. It covered their heads, coming to a slightly pointed rim over
    their eyes, and, in back, fell over their necks and shoulders in three
    pieces of loose cloth. Stringer wished he had one. It was very hot.
  </p>

  <p>
    The company stopped once, changed carriers, and continued out of the woods
    past some farmland. Now Stringer saw the town beyond. It sat overlooking
    the fields from its citadel, a large flat hill, steep and maybe thirty
    meters high. Beyond the hill the ground leveled off but rose once more in
    less than a kilometer to other hills that were even higher.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a few moments he was being carried up one of the many stairways that led
    to the top of this acropolis and into the town. To the thirty people in his
    retinue more continually added themselves, always pointing and chirping
    like children. Stringer did his best to ignore them and concentrated on the
    town itself. He was surprised to see it dotted with windmills. (Actually,
    Stringer had never seen a windmill before, but that was what he was looking
    at.) He opened his mouth to ask about this but closed it again abruptly
    when he realized that in many ways he was now a prisoner. The vanes of the
    windmills, resembling not pinwheels but vertical eggbeaters, whirled
    continuously in the brisk wind that blew dirt into his eyes. Then Stringer
    noticed that all the roofs of all the buildings were strikingly
    sloped. Some were sloped on all sides, some just on the northern side. But
    all were sloped and all had openings in them that pointed north. The fact
    that everything was also painted bright white did not hit Stringer until a
    few minutes later.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now the party was approaching a large central park that was covered with
    that strange grass or moss. A number of pod-trees were arranged in an
    immense circle that circumscribed the ring shape of the park itself. At the
    center of this ring was a huge circular plaza that must have had a radius
    of at least one hundred and fifty meters. It was almost flat, rising to a
    slight mound in the middle, and was made of something like concrete; across
    it ran four curves of metal inset into the ground. The metal bands
    stretched from one end of the plaza to the other on the northern half,
    following long oval paths that were streaked with etched-in markings. The
    plaza surface itself was cracked with fine lines and the metal was
    tarnished and smooth. Stringer looked up to see a large, tent-like building
    sitting exactly in the center of the circle, higher than anything else in
    the town. It was as if a great, solid tepee had been mounted on huge wooden
    pillars so that one could walk freely beneath. Then Stringer looked down
    and saw the shadow, diffused by the clouds, cutting across the ground,
    stopping at the outermost band. He traced the shadow back to its origin, a
    slender rod on top of the tent. The plaza was a sundial, of course, and the
    rod its gnomon, but Stringer didn't know what that was. And it was past
    midday.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a brief moment Stringer could see virtually the entire town from this
    vantage point; then he was taken inside the tent and set down on the
    floor. Several fires were burning, sending curls of smoke shooting up
    around a large square map that hung from ropes above his head, and out a
    small hole in the apex. Nearly seventy people were in the tent, and at his
    entrance, the noise level shot up. The thirty who had brought him stood
    around him in a semicircle facing a row of older men and women. Stringer
    felt as if he were between the jaws of a vise.
  </p>

  <p>
    He thought an argument was in progress involving the man and woman who had
    carried him most of the way from the wreck. Stringer did not hear raised
    voices and screams. The volume stayed nearly constant, but pitches
    traversed octaves and speeds modulated quickly. This went on for a long
    while. Finally the woman turned to her male counterpart and shrugged. They
    picked up the stretcher and carried Stringer out of the tent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not far away—beyond a large archway that stood at the edge of the plaza,
    and beyond the park—they passed an old man sitting with a baby on a
    doorstep and entered a prismatically shaped building. Stringer was
    deposited in a small conical room that adjoined the main structure. Soon
    the woman brought him some food, shoving the bowl into his hands, and
    Stringer ate voraciously. When he asked for more, the woman refused and put
    the bowl away. Then she pointed to herself and said, <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Taljen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Benjfold,</q> the man said, pointing at his own
    chest.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Stringer,</q> Stringer said, and the language
    lesson had begun.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    For about the next month that queer conical room was Stringer's home. He
    had a large mat for sleeping. There was a basin with a pipe leading to it
    that let in a rush of water when opened and a leaky dribble when stoppered,
    which disturbed Stringer's unpleasant dreams. Taljen checked frequently to
    make sure no water was lost. Stringer even had a toilet of sorts that
    emptied somewhere beneath the house. Two stools and a fireplace, whose
    dented metal chimney rose through the sloping walls, completed the
    furnishings. The walls themselves were made of the leathery, smelly wood of
    the pod-trees, and the three windows out into the wall looked trapezoidal
    when viewed straight on because of the slant. Finally, a continual hot
    breeze was let in through the hole in the roof and was cooled somewhat by
    the leaves and branches placed in the flow. As the month went by, Stringer
    thankfully noticed that the breeze became noticeably cooler but
    unthankfully stronger.
  </p>

  <p>
    During that same month his leg healed enough so that he could begin
    exercising it again, and he learned the language of Ta-tjenen. Taljen and
    Benjfold would sit and drill him to hours on end, teaching him as they
    would a child and showing no mercy. When they finished a session, he would
    be sent out into the streets with his crutch. The streets of Ta-tjenen were
    usually empty. People walked quickly to escape the sun and never seemed
    interested in talking to each other, but when they saw Stringer, they, too,
    would stop and drill him. He developed violent headaches from
    concentration. <q>You can do it,</q> his dreams told him. <q>You can even
    stand up. Stand up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The first thing that Stringer asked when he knew enough words was what had
    happened to Valyavar.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">There was a Gostum near you and we ate him,</q>
    Taljen replied.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer missed some of the words but thought he understood enough. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">What? You ate him?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You seemed not to mind when we gave you some of him
    shortly afterward. We eat our own if they die unsick. Do you think we can
    afford to waste food?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Again Stringer missed words but shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No,</q>
    he replied, guessing at the question.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of the month, or thereabouts, Taljen returned after a long
    absence and, sweating, sat down in front of Stringer, cross-legged as
    usual, chin resting on hands resting on knees, staring straight into his
    eyes. Stringer stared back, but not, he guessed, for the same
    reason. Taljen was beautiful and he enjoyed watching her. Her mahogany hair
    hung in loose curls over her shoulders and breasts and swayed heavily when
    she turned her head or when the wind caught it just right. Her complexion
    was dark, as dark as her hair, and her eyes, set deeply, were
    blue. Stringer had never seen blue eyes before, but even so, they seemed
    out of place on such a face, much as his own apple-green eyes were out of
    place on his own olive skin. The most disconcerting thing on her very human
    body was her six fingers, two of which seemed to be thumbs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen shrugged and his stomach growled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Can I
    have something to eat?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You've eaten eight times with the beclad. No
    more. You've had your ration, and the fields aren't to be strained for the
    likes of you, Alien.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer pressed his stomach inward with his fingers. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Well,</q> he said slowly, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I
    suppose you want to begin the drill.</q> He sighed, not wanting another
    drill now. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You know,</q> he went on, trying to
    start a conversation with his still-crippled tongue, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">you have a beautiful language. I like it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I wouldn't know,</q> Taljen replied, <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">It is the only one I have ever heard. But why do you
    mention it, Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I never liked Bitter very
    much. It's flat; there is no variation in sound. Your language uses the
    voice. Speed changes and volume and pitch. It is like a song. It's
    nice. But it is hard, though. My voice isn't used to making so many
    different sounds.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen shook her head with a regal toss, as she so often did. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Well, Stringer Murderer, I am not sure you will have
    much time to speak Tjenen. You should understand the mixture of fear and
    respect you cause. You should understand that most of Ta-tjenen wishes you
    killed. However, since violent death is so unusual for us, no one is
    exactly sure what to do with you. Now the nestrexam will decide its own
    mind.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What is the nestrexam?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You will find out soon enough. Come on, Alien.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer stood and turned away from Taljen. He opened the shades covering
    the windows, which he had fashioned himself. The Tjenens could sleep in the
    light. Stringer hadn't yet managed that. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Please
    don't call me that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Alien? Why? That is what you are, simply. An Alien
    Murderer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, I suppose so. Then why have you been taking
    care of me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Not to widen my ears, of that you can be sure. I
    found you when I was counting trees for a tree survey. So I am taking care
    of you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Thank you. You have been kind. Now I suppose we
    should see the nestrexam. Tell me, will it matter what I say to them?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer puzzled about that as he stood in the meeting tent while it
    gradually filled, very gradually and even more quietly. People straggled
    in, and the elders who evidently made up the nestrexam wandered in
    similarly unconcerned with keeping the rest waiting, as if they were not
    aware that they <em>were</em> keeping the rest waiting. Finally a bell
    sounded from outside, and what little talking there was ceased as the last
    to enter took their places.
  </p>

  <p>
    An old woman whose face was marked with the signs of years, winds, and sun
    took her place on a circle painted on the floor in the exact center of the
    tent. Over her head, hanging from ropes, was that large square map which
    Stringer took to be the local area. The others sat in a row behind her and
    faced Stringer as Taljen led him forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">I stand in the Center for this house-change and the
    next. My name is Kenken Wer, although hopefully you won't be here long
    enough to use it. We must decide what to do with you. Are you
    Polkraitz?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't think so.</q> Whatever that was.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="elder">He would know if he was,</q> said one of the elders,
    leaning forward to Kenken Wer.
  </p>

  <p>
    She turned on him. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">This is the Golun-Patra. Remember
    that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="elder">I had forgotten.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Ask the Time Keeper, then, if you cannot remember
    such things yourself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The old man sat back meekly, obviously having made a grave slip. Kenken Wer
    turned her attention to Stringer again. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">You killed a
    woman shortly after you arrived. This is serious. Life is precious at
    Ta-tjenen, not to be wasted. This is the first k…killing that I know of
    since the revolt. It is unclear what is to be done. Do you have an
    explanation?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I was confused,</q> Stringer said <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I thought I was being attacked.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">You were being helped.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I realize that now. Where I come from one isn't
    helped.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I am not interested in your excuses. You acted as I
    would expect a Polkraitz to act. There is, however, some question as to
    whether you are Polkraitz or not. The opinion is divided. If you turn out
    to be Polkraitz, we will have to act immediately. Until then…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer began to think that they were more concerned about whether he was
    Polkraitz than about the murdered woman. He lost track of what Kenken Wer
    was saying until he heard:
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">…so we have decided to do nothing. You may stay
    until the Patra. The teclads are shortening, as are the beclads themselves,
    and the Patra will come. If you are gone by then, you are gone; if not,
    then the Patra will embrace you. Taljen, you will be responsible for him
    until then. Let us know his decision.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Can I go to my ship now?</q> Stringer asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Go,</q> said Kenken Wer, her long fingers
    interlocked beneath her breast. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">I hope the Center
    does not see you again.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I'll take you,</q> Taljen offered. She led Stringer
    out across the plaza, streaked with markings and small pylons, out of
    Ta-tjenen itself, and to his ship. It was as it had been a month earlier,
    at the base of the cliff—not so high, it seemed now!—tilted toward the
    right. The fern-moss underneath had turned brown, and a purple fungus had
    begun to creep up on the hull.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer circled around the craft and instantly saw that it would fly
    nowhere. The left wing had been largely sheared off, leaving a ragged gash
    at the stump. It would require a factory to repair that wound. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, I half suspected that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen regarded the huge gash and ran her finger across one edge. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Does this mean that you cannot fly away?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer chuckled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Of course—no, I guess you
    wouldn't know. Yes, that's what it means. The plane is broken.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">So what will you do now, Alien?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'll show you.</q> Stringer grasped the latch and
    pulled his hand back with a violent jerk. Taljen laughed. This time
    Stringer covered his hand with the cowl from his sun suit and yanked the
    hatch open. After waiting a few minutes for the cabin to ventilate, they
    climbed in. Taljen unstrapped her water flask and gave Stringer a drink. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Just one,</q> she said, smiling, when he asked for a
    second. Now he saw that the cockpit window had been shattered. Dust covered
    the console.
  </p>

  <p>
    As he sat at the communications desk, he explained while he flipped
    switches, mixing both Bitter and Tjenen words when the latter language—or
    his vocabulary—lacked the words he needed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We have
    a large rocket in orbit around this planet. Inside there are several more
    ships like this one. I should be able to connect the controls of this craft
    to one of the others left in orbit. Then I will be able to pilot the other
    here by remote control.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen said nothing. Stringer did not know how much she understood of his
    Bitter-Tjenen mixture, or even how much she understood of the concepts. But
    she did not seem surprised. Stringer began his task.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You are unhappy,</q> Taljen said after a few minutes
    of observation, and she sat down on the floor behind Stringer. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">You should dance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I can't get any picture from the craft in
    orbit. Either it's out of range or something is wrong.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Can you fix it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer continued to work. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't know what's
    wrong. Nothing is coming through, that's all. It might simply be that the
    ship is on the other side of the planet. In that case, I'll just have to
    wait. Otherwise it might take—</q> Then Stringer realized he had no word
    for <q>day.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer,</q> Taljen said slowly, but in one of her
    higher voices, <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I don't understand what is wrong,
    what an <q>orbit</q> is, or how you are doing what you are doing, but I
    think you are in much trouble if you do not leave Ta-tjenen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer gazed at her, as he always found himself doing before he talked to
    her. He did not understand the intonation in her voice, a mixture of
    concern and anger. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I know,</q> he said, tapping
    his forefinger on the panel. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Tell me, the old
    woman said life was precious here, that I had committed a serious crime. On
    my world that just isn't true. But if it is here, then why isn't any action
    being taken against me now? No one seemed to care about the woman, only
    about Polkraitz.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen looked puzzled at the question. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">The woman is
    gone. I currently knew her as well as any, I suppose. But soon I would not
    have known her, as with everyone here. It is just as if that time came
    sooner. Everything would have changed, anyway, and she would be just as
    gone.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer didn't understand any of that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen went on. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">But if you are Polkraitz, that is a
    continuing problem. When they come, we do not know what they will do. If
    they are allies of the Gostum, the danger could threaten us all. So what
    will you do? Where are the other Aliens you told me about?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't know. One you ate. Two we left a long way
    south—about a hundred thousand kilometers. Why they haven't followed the
    beacon I don't know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">So what will you do now, Stringer Lost?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I must go south. It will take</q>—no word for
    years—<q ab:speaker="Stringer">a long time. But I can't stay at
    Ta-tjenen. I didn't understand most of what Kenken Wer said, but it's clear
    that they'll kill me sooner or later.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen laughed, but the laugh turned quickly into a frown. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">I'm sorry, Stringer, but to go south is
    impossible. Why, one hundred thousand kilometers! I don't even believe the
    world is that big. Even if you went, you would never survive.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why not? If I built a boat—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">If the heat didn't kill you on such a trip, you
    would freeze to death.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Stringer laughed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What? This place is hotter
    than an impossible summer, and you tell me I'll freeze to death?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen studied his face, scanning every centimeter of it with her eyes. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">You don't understand, do you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No. I suppose I don't.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen began to comprehend that perhaps Stringer really didn't understand
    what she had always taken for granted. This Alien must come from a very
    strange world indeed. Now she spoke slowly and her voice was low. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Why do you think we call our world Freeze-Bake?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer laughed again. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Freeze-Bake?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Why, yes, did we forget to tell you?</q> Taljen did
    not see the humor that Stringer (and undoubtedly we also) found in the
    world's name.
  </p>

  <p>
    He shook his head and saw a drop of sweat turn the dust on the console a
    darker brown. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">All right, why is this place called
    Freeze-Bake?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">The sun! Stringer, look at the sun!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer peered out of the cockpit and saw the sun. He blinked his
    eyes. The sun was below the tops of the nearby pod-trees.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Has it moved?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    But so slowly that he hadn't been conscious of it. Indeed, the sun, far
    south, was several, though not many, degrees east of its position when he
    had arrived and somewhat lower, too. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So it does
    get dark here. No one bothered to tell me. And, of course, why else would
    it be getting cooler?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Now you see. Foolish Stringer, that the sun is going
    down and the teclads themselves are shortening. In less than two teclads
    the Freeze will begin. if you went south now, how far could you get before
    the rains became heavy, then snow and the winds like a crazed Verlaxchi?
    And then the dark. It is a Short Patra, this Patra-Bannk, the Time Keeper
    has told us. Nonetheless, it is longer than this Bannk. And it will get so
    cold that the air itself, I am told, is on the verge of falling out of the
    sky. If you started south now, you might make it as far as the next town;
    otherwise you would freeze to death in two teclads. You see, action is
    being taken against you. It makes things very simple, Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes.</q> It was simple. The sun was going down and
    taking the temperature with it. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What is a
    teclad?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen tossed her heavy hair, as she so often did. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">A
    teclad? One teclad is not like another, but there are six in the Patra and
    six in the Bannk. A Patra-Bannk is one pass of the sun, or suns. After all,
    it could be a new sun each Bannk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer ignored the last remark. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But you just
    told me that Patra-Bannk is the name of your world.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Patra-Bannk, yes. It makes much sense, don't you
    think?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, Patra-Bannk, Freeze-Bake; it makes much
    sense.</q> Stringer looked up from the panel to Taljen. Even he detected
    the weariness in his own voice. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why didn't you
    tell me this before?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I'm sorry,</q> Taljen said slowly. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">I thought everyone knew about things like that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What we assume!</q> Stringer muttered. But now he
    knew, at least, what Kenken Wer had meant when she said, <q
    ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">The Patra will embrace you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Besides,</q> Taljen continued, <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">I wasn't teaching you for your information, but for
    ours. Tell me truthfully, Stringer,</q> she said, recrossing her legs, <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">why did you come to Ta-tjenen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What difference can it make now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I would like to know, that's all.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It would seem because I'm Polkraitz—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen jumped up. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You are?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, no.</q> Stringer quickly retracted when he saw
    her reaction. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't even know what
    Polkraitz is. We came to find a great city that was on Patra-Bannk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Ta-tjenen?</q> The question was asked with perfect
    innocence.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No,</q> laughed Stringer softly. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I doubt that very much, even though Hendig is a
    liar.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Hendig? Who is Hendig?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">He is the man who had been on Patra-Bannk and then
    came to my world to tell us about the city. When we found Ta-tjenen we
    thought you might be able to tell us where it was, but we crashed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen sat down once more and propped up her arms on her knees. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">I am sorry that you crashed. You see, other than
    Ta-tjenen, there is little else to find. But tell me, why did you want to
    find this imagined city you speak of?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was about to speak, but the words caught in his throat. He flicked
    away some of the dust on the console with his fingers. They left a smeared
    trail behind. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I…I think it's time to get up,</q>
    he said, and pushed himself to his feet. Stand up. Stand up. You can even
    stand up. You can even stand up! The words flashed back to him again, as
    they had many times earlier. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Sarek! Why didn't I
    think of this before?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer, what is it this time?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Nothing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Why don't you say anything? If you want to learn how
    to talk like a Tjenen, you'll have to learn how to talk. Those of Ta-tjenen
    talk a lot, certainly compared to you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why should I want to talk like a Tjenen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">All right.</q> Taljen had helped him even though
    he was under a death sentence. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Wait a moment and
    let me think this through.</q> Stringer stood silently for a minute with
    his hand on his chin, staring absently in the direction of the cabin
    wall. Then he looked up and said, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It's
    impossible.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What is, Cryptic Alien?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Tell me, what do you know about science?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I have been the Time Keeper's assistance on certain
    free shifts. I was also his pupil during the Patras.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You never told me you study science.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What have I ever told you, Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">True. I used to study science some, but no more
    than any kid, and that was a long time ago. I'm not a scientist, that's for
    sure. But I just remembered an exclamation that I heard on Two-Bit long
    ago, in a place I'd rather forget. I ignored it the first time I heard it;
    it made no sense to me then and I let it go. Pike never mentioned it to me;
    either he didn't believe it, which is most likely as Hendig is a liar, or
    he never thought of it. I don't know. But it's bothered me in my dreams
    ever since that first time, and now it popped into my head again. Now I
    know what bothered me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Go on.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You see,</q> said Stringer, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I come from a world very much smaller than
    Patra-Bannk, more than fifty times smaller in diameter—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">That makes Patra-Bannk very large or your world very
    small, doesn't it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Patra-Bannk certainly is very large, by any
    standards I've ever heard of. It's more than six hundred thousand
    kilometers in diameter.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen shook her head resolutely. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I don't believe
    you, Stringer Who Tells Stories. I can't conceive of that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It is. And yet I am standing up. Doesn't that
    bother you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No, should it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Don't you see? The gravity should be dozens of
    times greater than it is on my world. But it isn't. It's about the same,
    only a little more. I'm standing up; I should be crushed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I know of gravity, of course, but I still don't
    understand what you are saying.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Stringer was perplexed. The problem must be easy if he could figure it
    out. After all, he knew only the simplest science and those occasional,
    spectacular discoveries that filtered down to the level of Elswer's. Why
    didn't Taljen understand? <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you know of
    gravity?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It pulls things to the ground.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Nothing more?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What else is there to know about gravity?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, Stringer though, how do I answer that? I guess we start from the
    beginning, since I don't know much more about gravity than the beginning
    myself. He began pacing the cabin back and forth, trying to remember,
    trying to form an explanation. Finally he looked up and said, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you know that the weight of me, or of any object
    on this planet, depends on how massive the planet is and on the radius, how
    big it is?</q> Stringer held up his hands, shaping a ball.
  </p>

  <p>
    Something in that explanation disturbed Taljen, and she rested her head on
    her knuckles. After a few moments of thought she asked, <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">But what if the world is very thin? If the gravity
    depends on the radius, shouldn't it also depend on the thickness?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Thickness?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes, of course, the thickness of the edge.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer himself was very confused now. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What
    edge?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer,</q> Taljen asked in a sharply modulated
    voice, <q ab:speaker="Taljen">what do you think this planet looks like?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do <em>you</em> think this planet looks
    like?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I assume the model you were proposing was circular,
    like a pancake, but as we have never seen the edge, that might not be the
    case. I always thought a square was the most reasonable shape; there are
    four directions.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What? A planet is round.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Fine. What about the thickness?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I mean, spherical, like a ball.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen looked at him in total disbelief. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You can't
    be serious. People would fall off the other side from being upside
    down. And, Stringer, look at the ocean. Does it curve like a ball
    would?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But Patra-Bannk is so huge.…When your ships go
    out—you have ships, don't you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes, of course.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">When they go out, what happens to them? Doesn't it
    look as if they sink into the ocean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No, they get smaller and smaller and fade out.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Indeed, Patra-Bannk was huge. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Look at the sun; it's
    a ball—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">A disk in the sky.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Oh, what's the use, Stringer though. Aloud he said, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">And I suppose you think Patra-Bannk is the center of
    the Universe, too.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Of course. Ta-tjenen itself, as a matter of
    fact.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer couldn't believe what he was hearing. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Doesn't the fact that an Alien came here do anything
    to upset that belief?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Aliens came once before to the Center. That is why
    we are here. There is no contradiction.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Stringer threw up his hands in defeat, his great discovery useless,
    unexplainable to this stupid woman. How could she believe that he should be
    crushed by a gravity dozens of times that which obviously existed if she
    didn't even believe the planet was round? And now what was he going to do?
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen answered that. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I think the nestrexam will
    want to know that you are to be here for some time to come.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They walked back in silence. The shadow on the plaza crossed the four oval
    curves fashioned of metal and inst into the concrete. At one, the outer one
    for the lowest sun, stood a marker at the intersection of that low sun's
    shadow and the metal scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tent was still filled. The elder looked up with some surprise when
    Taljen and Stringer entered. Kenken Wer rose and faced him. Her face was
    old, too old for Stringer to make a guess at her age, too old for Stringer
    to be interested. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">You are still here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    That was obvious. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">My ship needs repair. It will
    take time.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">As we have said, you, Called Stringer, will be
    allowed to remain until the Going Under. By then you will have departed or
    the Patra will embrace you. Do you understand?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Enough,</q> Stringer replied, and left the tent.
  </p>

  <p>
    A hand grabbed hold of him and yanked him about. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Where are you going, Stringer?</q> Taljen asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That small red pylon marks the beginning of the
    Patra, doesn't it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">As you see, the scale ends there.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The pylon rising out of the pavement at the end of the curve was still many
    meters away from the sun's shadow, but the shadow itself had moved many
    meters since Stringer had arrived. A cloud suddenly passed across the sun
    and cooled the air momentarily. Stringer wanted to laugh. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">In less than two teclads—whatever they are—I freeze
    to death. What exactly happens to Ta-tjenen I don't know. But I think I'd
    better get to work.</q> His voice trailed off and he walked, hunched over,
    down the hill.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer appeared and put her hand to Taljen's shoulder. <q
    ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Beware of that Alien, Taljen. Stay away from him as
    much as possible. There is no good in him.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen sighed as she turned away from Kenken Wer and watched Stringer
    walking away slowly, a slight limp still present in his stride. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Ah, Stringer from Elsewhere, you come as a murderer,
    are as silent as an escaping prisoner, claim you have never had an
    education beyond a Patra-Bannk, learn our language in a teclad, and ask
    questions of which we ourselves cannot dream. Ah, Stringer…</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Six</div>A Propitious Arrival and
  a Hasty Retreat</h2>

  <p>
    Pike was angry. Muscles tense and bulging, he paced up and down the wide
    room in lengthy strides. He might well have been a bull charging at an
    unlucky victim. He snorted and grumbled aloud. <q ab:speaker="Pike">What do
    they want from us, those black and orange—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Enjoy it; we're being treated well enough, aren't
    we?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    If Pike had taken the time to absorb his surroundings, he would have agreed
    that Paddelack was right. The room was huge, fifteen full meters long and
    at least ten meters wide. Although it was hewn out of solid rock, the thick
    carpets and cushions of various colors on the floor, the heavy draperies
    hanging languidly from the walls, and even a fountain with a pool around it
    served to make the room a most splendid prison.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike reckoned they had been here more than a week, but as his only measure
    of time was his broken watch and his own sleeping habits, he couldn't be
    sure. And what of Valyavar and Stringer? Had they tried to follow the
    beacon? Were they lost? Were they on the way? No answer was forthcoming.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I'm hungry,</q> Paddelack remarked with some
    enthusiasm. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Are you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">That's your problem.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I think your appetite has increased three hundred
    percent since we got here, friend.</q> Exactly where <q>here</q> was, Pike
    didn't have the faintest idea, although he assumed it to be the Gostum
    headquarters.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack called into the adjoining corridor, and within a few minutes a
    girl arrived, tall, slim, with waist-length hair, wearing well-fitted pants
    and nothing else.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">At least they understand the uses of
    sex on this planet,</q> Pike grunted. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Undeniably. They
    certainly do a better job than Elswer's. One would suspect that they are
    trying to make us thinking we're dreaming.</q> Pike continued his pacing
    without any hesitation or a break in stride.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Of course! Don't you see that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack laughed. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What better way to get on good
    terms with us than to try to convince us we're in paradise? Maybe it is a
    little crudely obvious, but enjoy it, anyhow, is what I say.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike was surprised at Paddelack's perception of the situation. He wondered
    why it hadn't occurred to him also. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well, Paddy, my
    companion in arms, even if this is a ten-quinten whorehouse, I'm not going
    to fall for it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Then take a walk while I do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike accepted the suggestion and walked out of the room in the same
    athletic stride. No one opposed him. He saw a few men and women dressed in
    the same black and orange, but they said nothing to him as he passed. The
    corridors were a maze, lit only by burning torches whose heavy smoke would
    suffocate them all sooner or later. He found a stairway and climbed. It went
    this way and that, not being able to make up its mind which way it wanted to
    go. The corridor divided; Pike went to the right and found himself on a
    balcony overlooking a large rocky chamber. The walls were uneven,
    rough-hewn. Pike did not stay a moment longer. He took the other turn this
    time and climbed once more. Soon he felt a cooling breeze blowing on him
    from around an unseen bend. Was this an exit? His mind, fogged in anger for
    a week, cleared immediately and he continued all the faster. Now it was
    brighter. A sunlit patch of brown stood out on the corner from the darker
    grays and blacks. Freedom so easily? It was hard to say. He rounded the
    bend, and the passageway suddenly ended in a large round opening cut into
    the wall. Pike stepped over the threshold and out.
  </p>

  <p>
    He stood at the tunnel's end on a terrace cut into the face of the
    mountain. Beneath him the mountain curved outward in huge jagged step until
    it met the plain below in an unseen boundary. But this was not the coastal
    plain that Pike had flown over. He looked to the right and to the left, and
    it was the same. The same. To all horizons it was the same. And what of the
    horizon? At first Pike could not understand the shadow of the giant
    mountains stretching far into the plain. Was the horizon so close? As soon
    as he decided no, the shadow seemed to jump back, assuming its proper
    proportion in that distance. How far was he seeing beyond that shadow?
    Twenty kilometers or a thousand? There was no scale, no way to tell. His
    senses balked; the view became two-dimensional, all perspective lost. But
    Pike was sure of one thing, no matter what his faulty vision told him: if
    there was a tree or a forest or even a mountain in that desert, it was
    invisible, dwarfed in size by orders of magnitude and inundated by burning
    orange sand. He guessed that Two-Bit could have sat comfortably in the
    middle of the plain and been rolled about like a ping-pong ball on a
    table. Pike felt for the rock railing and leaned on it for support. It is
    an evil world, this, he thought.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack emerged from the tunnel with several of the Gostum following
    behind him. He spoke to Pike slowly and not unkindly. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">You begin to understand what Patra-Bannk is all
    about.</q> He took Pike's arm. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Well, come, these
    men want to talk to us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike stood erect, shook a fist at the desert, and paused for a moment with
    silent, glazed eyes. Then: <q ab:speaker="Pike">You must have finished with
    the girl quickly, Paddy.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">No, you've been away longer than you think.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack and Pike followed the Gostum to a cavernous room whose walls were
    roughly hewn in parts, flat in others, and, in places, still contained
    stalactites hanging from the ceiling. Circling the room above their heads
    was a relief depicting a series of events at which Pike could only
    guess. The carvings themselves were stained with soot from the flaming
    torches below. The two aliens were directed to sit at a large wooden table
    in the center of the room.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the other end of the table were gathered a group of men. Two had beards,
    long and tangled, with gray hairs interwoven with red and strands of
    black. Another: beardless with a craggy face, little darker than Pike's
    own, but convoluted with the lines of many years. He wore a fur mantle
    whose long hair draped over his arms and whose weight—if not his age—caused
    him to be bent over. The staff he carried was longer than he was, of black
    wood and intricately carved. Next to him was a tall young man, a boy by
    comparison. His robe was blue and light, his hair strikingly blond, and he
    stared off into an unknown distance.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a moment Pike looked beyond the men to the dais at the end of the
    room. Two guards stood there on either side of what must have been a
    clock. it buzzed and whirred, lying there on its cloth-covered table, and
    even from this distance Pike saw a large hand move a notch at the sound of
    a click.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the prodding of the staff, the young blond-haired man turned to a
    curious set of objects resting on the council table.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">Determine the Angles, Effrulyn,</q> Paddelack heard
    the old man say. Pike heard gibberish.
  </p>

  <p>
    The boy picked up the first object, which consisted of many metal bars,
    gleaming with reflected torchlight, tied loosely together in some sort of
    random three-dimensional figure. He dropped it to the table, where it fell
    with a crash, and the bars rearranged themselves. He took another object,
    resembling a pair of calipers, and bent his face to the skewed latticework
    of bars. After a few moments of measurement—of what, neither Pike nor
    Paddelack could tell—he stood up and nodded wearily to the old man.
  </p>

  <p>
    The old man took a heavy step toward Pike and spoke briefly in a raspy
    tenor, then left.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike shook his head and fidgeted with his untrimmed beard. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">You'll have to translate, Paddy.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Fine with me. His name is Fara-Ny, and he is the
    titular head of the Gostum. Says they want our help with a great and
    glorious mission. The Trieskans are building rockets to carry their people
    away from Patra-Bannk, and the Gostum must gain the knowledge of how to
    build rockets so that they too can leave.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Why do they want to get off Patra-Bannk? No, never
    mind that. Who are the Trieskans, anyway?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I've heard of them. Old enemies of the
    Gostum. Not sure, but I've been told that they live about one hundred
    thousand kilometers north of here. I could be wrong about that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">One hundred thousand kilometers! Tell me, then, would
    you, how these people even know about them. They raise horses, giraffes, or
    whatever you call those animals, don't even have electricity, and here they
    are talking about rockets being built at a place one hundred thousand
    kilometers away. How do they even know what rockets are?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike was interrupted by the return of Fara-Ny. He carried a large paper,
    rolled up into a cylinder. He laid it on the table and slowly unfurled
    it. The ends dangled over the edge of the table. It was a map of some of
    the world. Pike quickly noted some familiar features: the large ocean, the
    mountains, and the desert. The Gostum pointed to a speck on the mountain
    that was labeled <em>Konndjlan</em>, although Pike couldn't read
    it. Fara-Ny drew his fingers up along the coastline and pointed again. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Triesk?</q> Pike guessed and let his eyes travel farther
    up and down again. The map was surprisingly detailed on this continent, too
    detailed to have been done by the Gostum. Pike gazed across the ocean, a
    large blue channel cutting the map neatly in two. Another continent
    there—or part of one. Pike's eyes stopped for an instant and he looked up.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You can add to my questions: how did they get a map
    like this?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack turned to Fara-Ny and questioned him at length. There was a
    momentary exchange and then silence.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">The map is a copy of one from the age of the
    Polkraitz, who made it for their surveys. The Gostum claim they are
    descended from the Polkraitz. As to how they know what the Trieskans are
    doing, Fara-Ny won't say. That is one of their greatest secrets, which is
    available only to the inner hierarchy; the Fairtalian guard. You'd have to
    be sworn in before they would allow you to possess that information.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">By Ostlan's Vase, this is the most nonsensical
    discussion I have ever—</q> Pike slammed his fist down on the table.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Don't take them lightly; they're Gostum, and for
    reason or no, they take themselves very seriously. We'll be in a fine fix
    when they decide to get rid of us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike demurred, sensibly, he thought. <q ab:speaker="Pike">What do they want
    from us? It would seem to me that if they can know what is going on one
    hundred thousand kilometers away, they can do something about it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">They want your ship and weapons to take a few men
    to Triesk and extract the vital information.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">They <em>are</em> out of their minds, the costumed
    clowns! Risk my only way off this planet in an imbecilic tribal war over
    something that can't possibly be true! Rockets! Sarek, what a joke!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Jedoval, I believe you are referring to.</q> As
    contritely as possible, Paddelack relayed the message to Fara-Ny and then
    said to Pike, <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">He said he would be happy if we
    thought about it further.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Not long afterward Pike and Paddelack were summoned out of their quarters
    for a second time. This time, however, they were not taken to the council
    chamber but to a small cubicle containing a single wooden desk on which one
    or two very old manuscripts were neatly piled to one side along with a few
    papers, also neatly ordered. Two torches burned on either side of the desk
    under ventilating hoods, and a candle standing near the entrance provided a
    little more light. On the desk, pushed to an extreme corner, was that
    peculiar latticework of metal rods, and at the desk itself sat the young
    man with the blond hair, whose name was Effrulyn.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the guards brought Pike and Paddelack in, the young man did not even
    look up. When one of the guards finally bent over Effrulyn's shoulder and
    pulled a piece of paper out from under his nose, he growled. <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Yes, what is it? What do you want?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="guard">The aliens are here. You were to have an audience
    with them, in order to more fully explain our wishes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">That. Well, yes, I suppose it is necessary.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The two guards left and Effrulyn stood.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What is that thing?</q> Paddelack asked him,
    pointing to the latticework on the desk, not waiting to be asked any
    questions himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn turned around as if he did not remember anything was on the desk
    at all. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">That? That is the Angler. I let the Angler
    fall and then read the Angles that are so formed. If conditions are right,
    the Angles so formed are good ones, and the Gostum may proceed with
    whatever plans they have in mind.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You are a fortune teller.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn jerked his head in amazement. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I am a
    mathematician,</q> he said with a distinct sneer in his voice. <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">That is my only concern.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Then why are you the Angler?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Because that is my job.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    By this time Pike was getting impatient. <q ab:speaker="Pike">What are you
    talking about?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">This man is the court astrologer—without the
    stars. Evidently our fate has something to do with the outcome of his
    Angles.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And, I ask you, what is our fate?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack relayed the question to Effrulyn.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">You have arrived at a propitious moment,</q> came
    the reply.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Do the Angles tell you that?</q> Paddelack asked
    in return.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">The Angles,</q> Effrulyn continued, <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">have the good sense to know a propitious moment when
    they see one. As I was saying, you have arrived during the twelfth Golun
    Patra-Bannk—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">So that's it!</q> Paddelack exclaimed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What?</q> Pike asked sharply, annoyed at having to
    receive second-hand information.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">For some reason,</q> Paddelack continued, <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">the folks around here use a double-calendar
    system. One's based on the Patra-Bannk, the other on this Golun thing. Only
    once in a great while—I'm not exactly sure when—they coincide. The Golun
    Patra-Bannk, or Golun-Patra for short.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">So?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">So. It seems there is also the expectation that
    the Polkraitz will return, that they vowed to return. Somehow the promise
    got mixed up with this Golun-Patra business, and on the Golun-Patra great
    things are expected. Not only that, but this is the twelfth
    Golun-Patra. And I already told you they count in twelves. A propitious
    moment indeed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And they believe in this?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Do you believe in this, Effrulyn, this
    Golun-Patra prophecy?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn turned back to his desk and said in his high tenor. <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">There is a thing called the Golun-Patra, though it
    may in no way differ from all the others. I do not know, as I have never
    seen one before. In any case, I am not concerned with these trivialities;
    they only serve to disturb the peace of my being.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What are you concerned with?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">My mathematics, I thought that would be
    obvious. Now, if you will excuse me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">That's all you wanted to tell us?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Since you seem to understand the Golun-Patra as
    well as I do, you may yourselves decide. As I have said, you are not my
    concern.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Once more Pike crossed the walkway that overlooked the stables. Once more
    he descended, this time to the stable floor itself. Opposite him, across
    the littered stone, was a door. The smell of animal was strong, but Pike
    did his best to ignore it. He took a torch from the wall and walked into
    the passageway with the uncomfortable feeling that the guard behind him was
    laughing. There were, as before, many turns, many forks, many rooms, many
    staircases, all leading not outside. Pike gave up later, hours later, very
    tired.
  </p>

  <p>
    He stumbled angrily into his quarters. <q ab:speaker="Pike">This place is
    like a labyrinth! They make no attempt to guard us, and I still can't find
    a way out. It's been weeks! Paddelack, where are you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Right here. Don't say weeks. They don't exist
    here. It's been about six beclads; a beclad is about three of our days.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Who the hell cares? I have failed to find a way out of
    here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You could have told them you'd help.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Shut up. You know that is impossible, don't you
    understand? Remember, you're the one who wants to get off
    Patra-Bannk. You'd think you'd be doing something more productive than
    lying there with that serving girl as if the world were ending. You'd
    expect I'd get some gratitude after all I've done for you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack compressed his eyebrows and looked as if he were going to
    explode. The tension in his face subsided and he said, <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Pike, <em>my friend</em>, as you would say, I would
    like you to make the acquaintance of Barbalan. She is a Gostum, trained in
    more skills than you imagine at present. And she is going to get us out of
    here.</q> He paused an appropriate instant. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Need
    we discuss any further how useful I have been in the past beclads?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike unwittingly let his mouth drop.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Sting flies, remember?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike shut his mouth. The girl, who had been sitting silently all this time,
    laughed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Is he very stupid?</q> she asked Paddelack simply.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">No, I don't think so,</q> Paddelack answered
    seriously. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Somewhat ignorant of Patra-Bannk, but
    not stupid and not to be brushed off easily.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What did you say, will you tell me?</q> Pike demanded.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">She wanted to know if you were stupid or not.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And what did you tell her, aged fellow?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack just grinned.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">All right, you win this time, Paddelack. How are we
    going to get out of this mountain fortress? We must be up four or five
    kilometers, with a desert out the window and a giant mountain peak in our
    back yard. My only guess is that we're on the other side of the range from
    Massarat, because we aren't getting any direct sun.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You're right about that. Barbalan tells me that
    we are about forty kilometers from Massarat. Not bad, considering it's
    Patra-Bannk, not bad at all. There are only two ways to get there from
    here: either it's over the top via the old pass, which takes you way north
    to the old settlement, and then you have to come down on the other side and
    backtrack; or you take the road. Obviously the road is more sensible since
    it is fairly direct. That leaves only three problems: getting our weapons,
    getting out, and getting away. Barbalan can probably take care of our
    weapons, or so she tells me. I think stage two is going to be the
    killer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Let's hope not.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Seems the entrance-and-exit procedure is pretty
    tricky. Now you'll see why nobody bothered trying to stop you from
    escaping. Barbalan, could I have something to write with?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack waited a few moments until she brought a writing implement and
    some finely made paper. Pike grabbed the sheet and fingered it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Not bad.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What? Do you think these people are primitives or
    something? You'll find a workshop downstairs in which sits something that
    looks suspiciously like a steam engine. It may be hard living on
    Patra-Bannk, but these people have as much raw intelligence as we
    do. Now…</q> Paddelack began drawing. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">The
    entrance here is over a gorge that is more than a hundred meters deep and
    about thirty wide. You walk out the front door and down you go, with only
    gravity to keep you company. However, they do have a lift which takes you
    down partway. Is that right, Barbalan? Good. So the lift goes down and
    stops on a wide ledge about thirty meters below the exit, maybe only
    twenty.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Sounds difficult but, I'd certainly say, not
    impossible.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I'm not finished yet. You land on the ledge and,
    of course, you're facing the opposite wall of the gorge, which is as high
    as the one you've just come down, and there's still twenty meters of space
    to cross. But the ledge you're on extends to the left, like so, until the
    far wall drops off. At that point there's something like a courtyard on the
    other side and a drawbridge to reach it. They have it worked out so that
    the drawbridge is up when the lift is down, and vice-versa.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Clever of them. That's too bad.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">And then you have to get through the cleft on the
    far side of that courtyard. The cleft is blocked by a huge stone gate over
    which is a guard turret. The slab which closes the gate—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Don't tell me. The gate is shut when the drawbridge is
    down.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Right. It's a pretty fancy system of
    counterweights, but Barbalan assures me it works, and works well. If you
    cut the cable to the drawbridge, which is virtually impossible, the bridge
    drops, but so does a two-thousand-kilogram slab of rock. So all you've done
    is trap yourself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike studied Barbalan's face for what surely must have been a full
    belclad. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Who are these Gostum that they should be so
    concerned about security?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">After talking to them, I wonder if it is security
    that they're worried about.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What else could it be?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Discipline to stay alive. You can't have mistakes
    on Patra-Bannk. You must have a zero-defects system, or you don't make it
    from one Patra to the next. The Liddlefurans, and I imagine their long-lost
    cousins the Trieskans, do things differently. But that's another story,
    best told once we get out of here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Hmm…Can you raise the drawbridge without going back up
    the lift?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">No.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Can we throw a rope across the gorge instead of using
    the drawbridge?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You're forgetting the grask.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What? Be clear, I ask you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Those animals you thought looked like tall horses
    or short giraffes. We'll need three of them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Three of them? Why do we need three?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Once we're out of here, do you think they'll let
    Barbalan live? They're Gostum.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, I suppose she <em>is</em> doing us a favor.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">She may be saving our lives. And remember, she's
    probably a better fighter than both of us put together.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I won't argue that question. So someone has to ride the
    lift back up to let the grask over the drawbridge. Then we might get two
    out, but the third is trapped on the ledge between lift and bridge. Rope,
    I'd say.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Can't see any other way of doing it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Wait. Can Barbalan take the grask out by herself? If
    she could get them out and have them waiting, it would be easier.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack transmitted the message for the narrow-eyed Barbalan. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">She says no. They must have permission to leave.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Can she get permission? Tell her to make up a
    story. Tell them that we will help the Gostum but we need to get supplies
    from our ship.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Again Paddelack translated. To Pike, Barbalan seemed relentlessly calm,
    intent on weighing each proposition as it was suggested, not allowing
    others to rush her decision. She replied to Paddelack in a fluid mezzo.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">She says it might work but that it would only buy
    us a little time, and we'd be on our own as far as getting out goes. Which
    is more valuable: a little time or her help?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I haven't the vaguest idea. You know her better than I
    do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Then I'd say we'd better stick together.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Fine, I'll trade you a blooded bronze on that one.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Done.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">When?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">As guards seem to be around always, why not as
    soon as Barbalan can get our weapons and some rope?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">So all our planning degenerates into a breakaway. Not
    very pretty.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Barbalan,</q> Paddelack said, changing languages,
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">you said you can get the guns.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes, I can do that,</q> she answered in her own
    tongue. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">No one knows how to use them, and they are
    relatively unguarded.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Rope?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes, there will be some in the stables.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Then are you ready to take your leave of the
    Gostum?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan bit her lip. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Why not? I think there are
    better things to do in life than stay at Konndjlan.</q> She got up from the
    cushion, grabbed her garments, and was about to leave the room when Pike
    stopped her.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">There is one final thing,</q> he said, addressing
    Paddelack.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What is that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">The map. The map is necessary.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Why?</q> Paddelack asked in return.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Do you want to get off Patra-Bannk?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack sighed, nodded toward Barbalan, and translated.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">The more things I must secure, the more difficult
    this impossibility will be.</q> Then she walked out, naked, into the
    corridor.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well, then, I'd say it was time to get our clothes on,
    wouldn't I?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack only flushed slightly and began to get dressed. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Remember, a grask is strong and fast. Keep it slow
    to begin with or you'll be thrown. Oh, hell, you'll find out.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    After Barbalan had left the two men and dressed, she made her way to the
    antechamber where both the weapons and the map were being stored. The
    single guard suspected nothing. The advantage was hers. She walked quite
    close, breathing normally, completely relaxed. Then with lightning speed
    she brought up her knife and plunged it into his throat. Barbalan caught
    him before he hit the floor, little fountains of blood spurting from his
    neck. To the right was the map. She quickly took it out of the cabinet,
    unrolled it, and folded it into a thick sheaf. The weapons. She searched
    three drawers before she found them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan had turned to leave when she noticed the dead guard. He was one of
    the Fairtalian. Of course! Otherwise he would never have been permitted to
    guard the maps. Around his neck was a gray chain and pendant that
    designated him as such. Pike and his stupid map, she thought. The guard's
    insignia is important. Here is the secret. Once she had been told that in a
    moment of carelessness by a Gostum with a loose tongue. Exactly what the
    secret was and how the necklace was associated with it, she did not
    know. But she did know she must have the medallion. Not to be removed, the
    chain was welded to itself. Barbalan thought quickly. This <em>is</em>
    important. She took her knife and cut the guard through the neck. The
    cartilage gave way with little difficulty and soon after the spinal cord
    crunched satisfactorily. With a final push the head separated from the
    torso. Barbalan grabbed the reddened necklace from the rapidly growing pool
    of blood, wiped her stained hands on the guard's uniform, and was off.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike and Paddelack were waiting where she had left them. Pike was pacing,
    Paddelack yawning. Barbalan gave the folded map to Pike. Before he tucked
    it under his hood, he hesitated, noting a red palm print on the
    cloth. Barbalan handed him the grasers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike armed his graser and gave the other to Paddelack. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Do you know how use one of these?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">It's not been so long that I've forgotten,
    youngster,</q> Paddelack replied.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Good. Two-two-one for yours.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan urged them on. They met no one before the stables. She crouched on
    the now familiar balcony overlooking the feeding grask. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">There are three guards down there. Do you see
    them?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The men nodded. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Why don't we just walk down. They
    don't suspect anything—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">—yet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan nodded. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Then watch me.</q> She stood up
    and walked down the curved stone ramp to the floor. The scene was dim. The
    torch flames struggled in the strong draft, and their orange glow flickered
    dimly on the rugged walls.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly Barbalan said something to the nearest guard, and within an
    instant he was heaped on the floor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack burned a hole cleanly through the chest of the second guard
    standing nearby at an archway.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike raised his gun and fired swiftly, but the third guard had already
    dodged and flung an object that skinned Pike on his forearm. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">How did he have time to throw that? I had him dead.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Be more careful next time,</q> Paddelack snapped,
    finishing the job and then helping Barbalan loose three of the grask.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Stand here,</q> Barbalan directed, and Paddelack
    dragged Pike over to the indicated spot. Now they were directly under the
    balcony. Barbalan pulled a lever and the floor began sinking. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">It is steam-operated, I think.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No wonder I never found the place!</q> Pike exclaimed
    with a mixture of admiration and anger.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan leaned toward Paddelack. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">A bell rings in
    the council chamber every time this floor moves. They will know someone is
    leaving and will soon guess who, if they haven't already.</q> Paddelack
    frowned and told Pike the bad news.
  </p>

  <p>
    The platform thumped to a rest in a large tunnel that opened about fifteen
    meters in front of them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan pointed. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">That's the lift, right in front
    of us.</q> Pike raised his arm and fired at the two guards. One fell with a
    scream; the other spun around. Paddelack fired in time with Pike's second
    shot, and the remaining guard toppled out of the tunnel.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">It is time to move swiftly. Don't stand there to
    be caught in the snow!</q> Barbalan shouted as she tugged on the grask
    reins.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">This isn't what I'd call an elegant escape.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What difference does it make as long as we get
    out of here?</q> Paddelack scowled in reply. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">It's
    a little late to worry about form, don't you think?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">A fine poet you are.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They ran out from the mouth of the tunnel onto the left. Pike and Paddelack
    staggered. The gorge itself dropped straight down beneath them, ending in a
    ribbon of a stream far below. The landing ledge, from this height, did not
    seem substantial enough to suit either of them. Paddelack cranked the winch
    and the ledge began moving closer. On his far left, Pike could see massive
    cables tightening as the drawbridge began to raise itself. Still no sign of
    anyone. No. Then Barbalan suddenly hurled her short spear at a Gostum who
    was running up from the bridge. She missed and cursed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">There are at least four more,</q> she said,
    unstringing her bolo from around her waist. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Watch
    out!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The lift hit the ground, but Barbalan was already in the air letting
    fly. Her opponent threw a spear that stuck in the bottom of the lift and
    snapped in two as the platform struck the ground. Paddelack wounded in one
    arm a second guard who was racing behind the first, and watched him draw a
    knife with his free hand. Pike finished the man for him. Barbalan seemed
    still to be in midair, flying after her bolo and simultaneously unsheathing
    her knife. The guard recognized her and hesitated an instant, just long
    enough for the bolo to catch his arm and for the knife to slit his throat.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Up, Pike, <em>up!</em></q> Paddelack cried as he
    mounted a grask and dragged the other two out behind him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike began cranking. It was easy; the counterweighting was perfect. His
    eyes flitted continuously from Paddelack on the ground to the mouth of the
    tunnel above. Thankfully, he couldn't see it because of the roof on the
    lift, but he looked, anyway. About two-thirds of the way up, the lift
    shuddered from a loud thump on the roof. So they've arrived, he
    thought. The drawbridge was nearly down. Barbalan was on graskback waiting
    for the bridge to come down still farther. She looked in Pike's
    direction. No turning back now, he decided, and kept cranking. Barbalan
    glanced again in his direction and suddenly spurred the grask onward. It
    bounded up the sloping bridge and leaped out of sight behind the far corner
    of the gorge wall.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Pike!</q> Paddelack shouted from below. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">On the roof! There's one of the roof!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You're no help at all,</q> Pike muttered. He stopped
    cranking and listened. The guard above him stopped moving too late. Pike
    fired through the roof, heard a soft groan, then silence. He bent to the
    winch again. It was jammed. It would only move down. There was little to do
    now but wait.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack turned from Pike and eyed the half-lowered bridge. Well, Barbalan
    had managed it, and he could, too. The grask was well trained and
    unhesitatingly bounded up and over the bridge. Even as he was touching
    ground, he could see Barbalan pressed against the wall of the guard
    turret. She pointed upward. A metal shaft whizzed by Paddelack's ear.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">We are out of our minds,</q> he muttered as he
    hid behind an outcropping on the gorge wall. Paddelack slid his thumb
    forward on the barrel of the graser, pushing a small lever to an extreme
    position. Last shot, he thought. He noted the turret window's position,
    stepped out from behind the outcropping, and fired directly into the
    window. There was a loud crack and the ceiling of the turret collapsed onto
    the guards inside. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Powerful things, those gamma
    rays.</q> He threw the gun away.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Barbalan! The rope!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan heard the cry and flung the lasso over a post on top of the
    bridge. Even before Paddelack had pulled it tight, she was climbing.
  </p>

  <p>
    From his vantage point Pike watch Barbalan lift herself over the raised end
    of the bridge, lower herself halfway down the other side with the rope she
    had pulled over, and jump on the lone grask. Once more she bounded up and
    over the bridge, disappearing from view.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike began lowering the lift. It was high time to get out of there. The
    lift descended at its own speed, but that wasn't nearly fast enough. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Move! Move! Bentagen, where are you?</q> The roof
    splintered with a crunching sound as a boulder smashed down on the lift
    from above. The rock struck the platform next to Pike. His feet began
    slipping out from under him, and he toppled over the edge.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike hit the ground hard, but it was not a far drop. His head reeled as he
    shook it in a desperate attempt to remain conscious. Then he sprang to his
    feet and ran, pausing only long enough to fire a shot over his shoulder
    into the mouth of the tunnel high over his head.
  </p>

  <p>
    The bridge was now fully drawn, presenting a near-vertical wall that would
    take him only straight up and not over the abyss. The gorge dropped off at
    his feet to the stream a hundred meters below, a barely visible ribbon
    snaking its way through the distant crags. Barbalan was at the gate, beyond
    the far court, standing over a body and clasping her shoulder. Paddelack
    stood immediately on the other side of the chasm, holding the reins of two
    grask. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">The rope!</q> he shouted. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">There, can you reach it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike's eyes followed Paddelack's outstretched arms to a rope dangling from
    the top of the bridge where Barbalan had left it. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I
    think so.</q> He leaned fully against the bed of the bridge and grabbed for
    the rope. A crossbow bolt buried itself into the wood next to his arm. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Now what?</q> he shouted. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Never
    mind.</q> He began climbing up the bridge. Halfway to the top, he
    straightened his legs, pushing himself out from the bridge, and swung in a
    wide arc over the gorge. At maximum swing he let go of the rope and
    dropped. To the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Don't stand up!</q> Paddelack cautioned. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Look behind you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike glanced over his shoulder. His right leg dangled over the edge of the
    cliff. <q ab:speaker="Pike">An elegant jump, wouldn't you agree? Close
    tolerance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Well…</q> Paddelack sighed, unconvinced, <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">close enough for government work.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Look! It's coming down! The gate!</q> Pike pointed but
    didn't stop to gape at the huge slab of stone that was rapidly closing off
    their exit. He jumped on the kneeling grask and hung on. Paddelack
    followed. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Move, you animal! <em>Move!</em></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The grask bounded forward with Pike clinging precariously to its neck, one
    leg trailing half a meter off the ground. Barbalan waved them onward from
    the other side of the gate, but Pike not only needed no encouragement but
    really couldn't do anything more.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stone monolith slammed shut. Pike breathed easily, however, knowing it
    was behind them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack turned from his examination of Barbalan's shoulder. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">A good day's work!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, I would agree to that.</q> Pike smiled, white
    teeth shining through beard.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Now where?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike"><em>Number Two</em>—and Daryephna.</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Seven</div>Death Row</h2>

  <p>
    His shoulders were stiff from hunching over, from working in tight places,
    from the nervous strain. Stringer slumped back in his chair, shivering and
    aching. He had spent the last several weeks going over everything once,
    twice, three times and again. What could be the problem? Anything could be
    the problem. With the tremendous jolt the shuttle had received on impact,
    it could be a cracked module, a misaligned laser, any of a thousand
    difficulties. But he could not raise the <em>Crimson</em>, and now there
    was nothing else to be done. Who was he fooling to think that he could fix
    this ship to begin with? Pike, where are you?
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer leaned over the console, head in hands, and thought
    desperately. He brought his water flask to his mouth, but it was empty. He
    threw it to the floor.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I thought I might find you here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer lifted his head to see first calloused fingers and then the tall
    woman stepping into the cabin. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Where else did you
    expect? You watch over me like a hawk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What is a hawk? Do you mean a sentry?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Never mind. What do you want?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    A shock of hair fell behind her shoulders as she tossed her head. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">As you say, I am to keep an eye on you. Do you think it
    would be good for you to go off killing someone else?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't think you have to worry about that,</q>
    Stringer replied, turning his back to her, randomly flipping switches on
    the control panel.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I'm sorry, there was no need for me to say that. I
    just wanted to see how you were progressing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I can't fix it,</q> Stringer said flatly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Ah, Stringer, Hopeless, what will you do?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't know,</q> he said, standing up. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">There doesn't seem to be much to do, does there?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">The Time Keeper would be the one to talk to, I
    think, but he is not in Ta-tjenen now.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I've heard him mentioned often. Who is he?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen smiled inwardly. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">He is a thing apart, with no
    nestrexa of his own. Untrusted by many but listened to at the same
    time. Even I rarely trusted him, and I was his best pupil. Definitely,
    Stringer, he is a thing apart, a true wizard.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer couldn't bother inquiring about a man who was probably a hermit
    living off in the hills somewhere. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm very tired
    now. I think I want to go to sleep.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Why do you sleep so often, Tired Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Because I must; what else can I say? I come from a
    planet where the sun goes down every fifty telclads or so—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Remember, though, a telclad is not a constant—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So I've heard. About every fifty telclads or so
    the sun goes down, and at about that time we go to sleep. I haven't figured
    out when you sleep, that's for sure. As infrequently as you do, it never
    seems to be at the same time.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen tossed her hair and laughed. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You are more a
    Tjenen in that than you think. You judge my sleeping habits by your own,
    but, according to our clocks, you are now sleeping half a beclad out of
    phase from your habit upon your arrival. You've been going to sleep later
    and later in the beclad.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I have?</q> Stringer pulled a watch from a
    drawer. The flashing digits meant nothing to him any more—he had not
    bothered to check it for weeks. He turned it off and hung it around his
    neck. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So I have.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">And I am sure you will continue shifting. Don't
    dismay, Funny Alien. Unless each of us pays close attention to the clocks,
    a thing only the Time Keeper does for sure, we all do the same as
    you. After all, there is so little to distinguish one beclad from another,
    what difference does can it make? Our body clocks take over and find their
    own cycles—and those vary slowly against the beclads as they will. They
    vary with the Patras and the Bannks, with the height of the sun in the sky,
    with the opening and closing of the pod-trees. Our bodies speed up and slow
    down, our skin changes color and texture. Next Bannk, the Killer Bannk, my
    skin will be so dark, so leathery, that you will not recognize me. This
    Patra I will change color again completely. That is the way Ta-tjenen
    works. That is the way each of us keeps time, by our own skin, by our
    feelings, by the color of our eyes. There is no universal time except that
    of the Time Keeper.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How can this city get
    anything done? It is so dangerous to live here—how can you be so lazy about
    something like that? Isn't everything mixed up?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Again Taljen laughed. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Not lazy at all. It is more
    efficient to let our work shifts follow our bodies. About the same number
    of people are awake at one time, so there is no problem in shifting
    shifts. If my shift gets later and later in the beclad, someone else's will
    get so late that it will be early. The nestrexam handles the list of
    Sleepers Awake and makes sure that it is always current. That is one of the
    nestrexam's major tasks. Similarly, classes in the Patra are held several
    times a beclad so all may attend.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer had not stopped shaking his head. Ta-tjenen was beginning to seem
    like a looking-glass city to him: flat world, shifting time, chameleon
    skin; couldn't these people do anything right?
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">But you are somewhat correct, Stringer. There are
    special occasions, like the Parlztluzan coming, which are easier to do all
    at once…I see that things here work in perhaps looser ways than you are
    accustomed to, but perhaps not. We manage well enough. Better to be a slave
    to your own body than to a mechanical clock, don't you think?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Ah,</q> Stringer sighed, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">there are so many things I don't understand about
    this place. Maybe someday—</q> He chuckled at the impossibility of that
    word. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Maybe someday I will, but who knows? Now it
    is time for me to get some sleep.</q> Stringer led Taljen out of the
    shuttle and they began walking back to town. He was surprised that he had
    healed so fast. His limp was almost totally gone. Perhaps it was time to
    pick up the kalan once more and keep in shape.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen tied the two outer cloths of her cowl together to protect her head
    from the bits of loose dirt that were being picked up by the winds, which
    were getting stronger all the time now. They had not gone far when they
    spied Benjfold, who was loading section of pod-trees into a large
    cart. Taljen ran ahead to him as he called out:
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Hello, Taljen, nesta, and Alien Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer did not reply, and as he walked by, Benjfold caught him by the
    arm. <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Could you give me a hand with this piece?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Silently Stringer grabbed one end of the log and they threw it into the
    cart. Silently Stringer turned away, but Benjfold began answering the
    unasked question.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">We go Under soon and will need all the fuel we can
    get for light and heat. You have no idea, I am sure, Alien Polkraitz, how
    much fuel Ta-tjenen will need to stay alive during this Short Patra.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer did not stop to listen but walked away.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen remained with Benjfold until they had filled the cart together. Then
    she kicked the grask and the large wheels began creaking over. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">You know, Benjfold, I do not think I understand the
    Alien very well.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Does it matter that you do?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It does not take much to see that he is not Tjenen,
    but to pinpoint the differences is harder. I wish I could climb inside him
    to understand. But we can never do that with anyone, can we? It is the
    ultimate block. Even you, Benjfold; I often wonder what is inside you,
    though I often suspect that it is not much.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">You're teasing me, aren't you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I'm sorry,</q> Taljen giggled. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">You shouldn't get upset.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They talked no further and headed toward the city. After leading the cart
    up one of the ramps to the citadel, depositing the wood in the nearest
    storehouse, and making a note of the entry, Benjfold and Taljen returned to
    Uslid's house. They crossed the plaza as they always did, and Benjfold noted
    that the long shadow intersected with the outer curve. He glanced up at the
    sky. Dark clouds were moving in. Rains had appeared occasionally beclads
    ago, and heavier ones would be coming soon. <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">It
    looks as if we'll be breaking up soon, doesn't it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">As we know…</q> answered Taljen, her voice trailing
    off. She felt the wind on her face, cooling now as the Bannk wore
    on. Jackets would be worn soon, and a little while after that…Windows and
    doors, usually left open, were now being closed. So it was with Uslid's
    house, or what was currently Uslid's house. Like most houses of Ta-tjenen,
    this one wasn't strictly theirs, they only lived in it with Uslid for the
    current Parlztlu, the current <q>change of houses.</q> Because Uslid was
    the oldest member of this nestrexa, a family that lasted for one Parlztlu,
    the house went under his name. When Taljen and Benjfold entered, Uslid was
    sitting in the main room.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Uslid">Ah, I have seen this before!</q> Uslid chuckled. <q
    ab:speaker="Uslid">It is nearing time to break up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes, that time is coming very soon,</q> said Taljen.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Uslid">And whom will you get?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I don't know.</q> She shrugged. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">There are a good many whom I like well enough,</q> she
    added with a smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Certainly. I suppose there is little reason to
    give the matter too much thought,</q> said Benjfold. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Will you stay with the child?</q> he asked, grinning at
    the small baby climbing around Uslid's leg whom Taljen had borne last Patra.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It might be nice to have a rest until the next
    Parlztlu, before the next child comes. After all, since I'm going off and
    so won't be fertile until then, it's allowed. And your old nesta did say
    she would take the baby.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Well, there is to be no rest for us,</q> Benjfold
    said. <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">I choose soon. What about you, Uslid?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Uslid">Ah, the libidinal flow is still there occasionally. I
    think I'll find somebody this time around. I'm past the mandatory age you
    know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">So,</q> Benjfold concluded, <q
    ab:speaker="Benjfold">ours was a good nestrexa; I hope my next is just as
    good. But then again, I suppose one is as good as another.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes,</q> Taljen agreed, <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I
    suppose so.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Stringer awoke to the sound of people in the street and music in the
    air. He shook his head in disbelief, never having heard so much noise in
    Ta-tjenen. His first impulse was to ignore it and get back to <em>Number
    One</em>, but then he remembered.…He stood, went to the window, and drew the
    blinds. The sunlight streamed in through the gaps in clouds, immersing the
    room in the yellow light typical of late afternoon. People were running
    this way and that, mostly diffusing in the direction of the great central
    park.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer dressed himself. Soon he was in the street and a few moments later
    he realized that his sun suit was not filling up with sweat. For an instant
    he was glad of that; the heat wave was ending, the heavy rains were on
    their way. But Stringer's smile did not last long. Although the sun was two
    dozen diameters or more above the horizon, the winds were getting stronger
    with the gradual drop in temperature before the Patra.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Stringer walked up the street, his cowl continually blew in front of his
    face and dust flew into his eyes. A myriad of colors swirled before him, in
    tempo with the shifting wind and the swaying crowd. This was indeed
    unusual. Dark colors absorbed heat and weren't worn as a rule. But yes, it
    was getting cooler.
  </p>

  <p>
    Music came from all directions. Sometimes the wind would shift and one
    group of instruments would fade out, only to be replaced by
    another. Stringer sought the source of the loudest sounds, working by trial
    and error as he was fooled each time by the vicissitudes of the veering
    flaw. He felt the atmosphere was toying with him, and he gloated in triumph
    when he stumbled, finally, onto the group he had sought. Two men were
    playing instruments with many strings stretched to a double head on one end
    and to a sounding gourd on the other. A woman was playing a long,
    reedy-sounding instrument riddled with holes. There was something different
    about the music, something more subtle and confusing than the music of
    Two-Bit; it reminded Stringer of the Tjenen language itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of the stringed instruments, newly made, were up for sale on a nearby
    rack. He picked one up, examined it, shrugged, and took it, leaving
    Taljen's name as payment. All accounts on Ta-tjenen would be settled on a
    special occasion during the Patra whose ice Stringer felt on the back of
    his neck. No doubt this account would be reckoned in as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer made his way across the plaza to the park. The gnomon's shadow had
    lengthened again. It seemed like a large jump since the last time he had
    seen it, but Stringer knew that it moved only a little at a time, degree by
    degree, monotonically toward the Patra. The shadow now rested on a blue
    marker standing on its curve. A special occasion? The red pylon on the end
    of the metal band was not a sixth of the scale's length away, and the sun
    was almost staring him in the eye. Stringer hurried on.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pod-trees were generating resin now, which would bind them close, and
    they smelled heavily of oil. More music and more dancing, pantomime about
    Polkraitz, and acting assailed Stringer's senses. These activities seemed
    totally unusual to him. Except for the outdoor shifts, people stayed in
    their houses, generally avoiding each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    It may have been several telclads later—Stringer wasn't sure—when he
    suddenly realized he had left the city. He found himself looking down on it
    from the northern hills. The plaza was in the center, the Center, and was
    surrounded on all sides by the park. A few streets started off radially but
    quickly meandered, and in the course of their haphazard journeys any wheel
    effect was lost. The buildings merged into one white mosaic that seemed to
    float a few centimeters before his eyes. The top of the acropolis must have
    been several square kilometers, which meant that Ta-tjenen was bigger than
    Stringer had thought. Twenty thousand people must live here, and for the
    first time since he had arrived, they were all out in the open.
  </p>

  <p>
    While Stringer sat, he heard a scuffling noise behind him. He turned around
    as several oddly dressed figures ran up the hill to his right. They were
    dressed oddly, but then again, for this occasion it was he who was dressed
    oddly. Stringer ignored the scene and set off back down the hill. The
    fern-moss covering the slopes was beginning to curl.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was met at the door of Uslid's house by Uslid, who, as usual, did
    not stray far from the doorway.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Uslid">What do you have there, Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer held up his instrument. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I just got it at
    the fair, or whatever this is. I thought I'd try playing it just for
    diversion.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Uslid">A rodoft, I see, and it is very difficult to
    play. But I can get you a teacher if you want.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No time for that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Uslid">Tell me, have you enjoyed the Festival of Lashgar and
    the Polkraitz defeat?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So this is the occasion of my defeat?</q> asked
    Stringer, wondering who could possibly have a name like Lashgar.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Uslid">And what do you mean by that, Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Don't you believe that I'm Polkraitz? Half the
    people around here do, whatever Polkraitz is—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Uslid! Uslid!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Uslid never responded to Stringer's question and swiveled around to see
    Taljen running up the street and out of breath.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Gostum have been seen! Everyone is on the watch!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Uslid">Gostum!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Someone said they saw a band of Gostum heading
    toward the north hills, but that's all. Should we join the search?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Uslid knew it was hopeless, and so did Taljen. <q ab:speaker="Uslid">We
    can. Maybe it is best we should. Do you know how many there were?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Four or five, I was told. So it might be
    dangerous.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer realized that he did not understand the discussion, so he went
    into his room and fell asleep shortly.
  </p>

  <p>
    He awoke later and found Taljen in her room eating by herself. Her normally
    wavy, well-groomed hair was now dirty and tangled. Her shirt and pants were
    covered with dirt and grime.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Am I interrupting?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No, of course not. Please come in, Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How long were you gone? I just woke up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I don't know. Who but the Time Keeper can ever
    tell?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Did you find what you were looking for?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">We didn't find the Gostum, Stringer, but that was
    expected because we didn't know where to look. Whenever the Gostum strike,
    it is out of thin air. Where is there to look?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Who are the Gostum?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The surprise at being asked that question was clearly evident on Taljen's
    face. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You don't know?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I wouldn't have asked if I did.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Their defeat is what we celebrate this beclad.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But who were they? Why were they at Ta-tjenen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen's eyes grew noticeably wider. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Why at
    Ta-tjenen?</q> she repeated with a toss of her head. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Isn't it obvious? Because, Stringer, Ta-tjenen is the
    Center. If you were going to found a great city, wouldn't you put it at the
    center of the world?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer winced, squeezing his eyes shut, and, of course, shook his
    head. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you mean you weren't joking when you told
    me that before, that the map in the meeting tent which show Ta-tjenen in
    the center really means it? It isn't just for convenience?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Of course it means it. Don't you see that Ta-tjenen
    is in the center?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But what about those other two cities on the map?
    Why shouldn't they be at the center as well?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">They were founded by Tjenens after the struggles
    ended. They are offshoots and not the Center, Alien. Other than those, do
    you see any more cities? It follows we are in the Center.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer brushed back his floppy hair with a quick movement of his hand. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't see how anything can be at the center. No one
    place on the globe is at the center.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen leaned back and smiled. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Ah, yes, that is
    right. You believe the world to be round like a ball. In that case, there
    is no center except the middle. Otherwise there is a Center, and Ta-tjenen,
    being the city of the Polkraitz, is it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">All right, all right. Forget that. Who were
    they?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">A great race living here. Ta-tjenen is a great city,
    don't you think, Alien? And before the revolt it was even greater—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">When was that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">When the Polkraitz founded the Center, it would
    appear. Since the Polkraitz fled on the first Golun-Patra and this is the
    twelfth, that would make twelve Golun-Patras ago, or about—let's see—eight
    belbannks.…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer began to feel as if he were walking around in circles for all the
    good that these nonanswers were doing him. But he quickly translated eight
    belbannks into over a thousand years. So the Polkraitz, whoever they were,
    left over a millennium ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">The Gostum decided to move the Center to the south,
    which was clearly an act of insanity and which the Tjenens resisted. But
    some of the Polkraitz, not knowing any better, sided with the Gostum. You
    can be sure there was a great war and a bloody battle over where to place
    the Center, here or in the south. Most of the population was destroyed;
    everything was lost, and things pretty much started over again. The
    Polkraitz fled, vowing to return, and their Gostum slaves were exiled. They
    left in ships like yours. Where they went we do not know, but they still
    come to plague us, fanatics who take us on five to one. They are indeed
    fanatics, dressing in black during the Bannk, black with one orange
    stripe.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Black and orange? I think I saw some people
    wearing those colors earlier.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You did! Where, Stringer, where?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I was sitting up over the city, on the north
    hills—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You were up on the north hills? Why didn't you tell
    us? Stringer, you knew that they were seen going in that direction. You were
    standing by when I told Uslid.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It didn't even occur to me. I thought they were
    part of the festival.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">How many were there?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Four or five.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen sprang up, her fury instantly doubled. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer! How can anyone act like you? Have you walked
    away from your mind? You knew we were looking for four or five on the north
    hills and you said nothing! Nothing at all! Are you that empty? A Tjenen
    you certainly aren't—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I said it didn't occur to me. I didn't even know
    what a Gostum was.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">If you were caught in the Patra would it occur to
    you? I suppose not. Oh, Silent Stringer, why do you never speak when you
    should?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I will be caught in the Patra, it has occurred to
    me. Has it occurred to you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer, I gave you an extra two teclads.…Now I
    understand you. I understand you well. You think only of yourself. You have
    no nestrexa in your mind, for sure. I've never heard of such mindlessness,
    Alien. Now, if you will not help the nestrexam, you will help me. Come
    on. Let's find the others.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer picked up a graser he had taken from the shuttle and led a group
    of several dozen to the spot where he had been sitting earlier. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">They were climbing straight up there.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen moved in the direction of the outstretched arm, and Stringer could
    see by the energy that manifested itself in the way she climbed that her
    anger had not subsided. He followed her. The ground was firm where it was
    not covered with the closing fern-moss, so there were no footprints to
    trace.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Didn't you cover this area earlier?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes, but not much farther up. Come on.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They continued up the hill until they reached the summit, finding nothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="someone">Well, that's the Edge,</q> said someone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer sat down.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What's wrong, Stringer,</q> asked Taljen. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">You look puzzled.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm sure they went up this way. But there doesn't
    seem to be any place for them to have gone.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">That's true. Aside from Ta-tjenen, there aren't many
    places to go.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But even you will have to admit they went
    somewhere.</q> Taljen remained thoughtfully silent as Stringer took a few
    steps down the hill. All he could see were the little ferns retreating into
    their spores for the Patra ahead. He sighed and glanced up. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Look! Do you see that?</q> He pointed as he cried,
    and all turned their gaze to the south, beyond the south.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen froze in her tracks. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Verlaxchi's against
    us. This is the end of Ta-tjenen!</q> She began running down the hill
    toward the smoke that was beginning to spread across the southern forest.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Because there was no darkness during the Bannk, save what was caused by the
    ever-increasing clouds, one could expect a good portion of the people of
    Ta-tjenen to be awake or asleep at any given time. The city, if it ran at
    all, ran continuously. By the time Stringer and Taljen had reached the
    central plaza, the gnomon's shadow could not be seen on the
    ground. Thousands of people crowded there, some still dressed in their
    festival garb, others in sun suits.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen shoved her way into the meeting tent, and Stringer followed as
    closely as possible. Because of her status as tree watcher, she was not
    hindered. Where she reached the tent the nestrexam was there, Kenken Wer
    standing as usual, but not calmly this time. There was no calm at this
    gathering.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Taljen!</q> Kenken Wer commanded. <q
    ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Tell me how we are set for fuel this Patra.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen stopped to catch her breath. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">We've completed
    the farming for this Patra. After all, we go Under in a teclad or less. So
    we are set this time. I cannot predict yet about the next.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    It was only then that Kenken Wer noticed Stringer standing behind
    Taljen. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">You! You Polkraitz! This is the Golun and
    you are Returned. You have brought this upon us! You and those Gostum
    beasts who are your slaves! I will tear your eyes out with my own
    hands!</q> She flung herself at Stringer, who drew his gun reflexively but
    then fended her off with his hands instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you think I would come to such a hellish place
    as Ta-tjenen of my own free will?</q> Stringer shouted as he caught the old
    woman by the arms. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You have a forest fire burning
    up your fuel. Don't you think you should worry about that instead of me? I
    am one man; your whole existence is at stake.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Kenken Wer, he is right. We have work to do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer jerked herself away from Stringer with fire in her eyes. <q
    ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">I will see to you later,</q> she spat at Stringer's
    feet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Benjfold appeared at that moment, pushing his way around bodies. <q
    ab:speaker="Benjfold">The wind is blowing mostly south and east,</q> he
    said, interrupting. <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">We are probably safe, but the
    entire forest is in the fire's path, and with the resin now being produced,
    who knows how far it could spread?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Because of the recent rain the forest is damp, but
    the resin is inflammable,</q> Taljen said. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">We have
    got a problem. It could spread all the way to Glintz. And Glintz, the Time
    Keeper has told us, is almost two thousand kilometers away.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">We must try to cut it off,</q> Benjfold
    decided. <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Everyone get tools and axes and
    shovels. We must try to cut it off.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    People started dispersing, but not quickly enough, Stringer thought,
    considering the emergency. When he left the tent he could see the smoke,
    opaline, rising up from the forest and fanning outward. It curled up,
    tightening on itself until the strong wind caught it and blew it
    southward. He thought he could see flames spreading across the treetops and
    imagined the crackling of bursting pods filling the air. He hoped that his
    shuttle would be all right; to hope was about all he could do.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ta-tjenen did not sleep that beclad. The smoke obscured the sun when the sun
    itself was not obscured by clouds. The air acquired an acrid taste that
    hurt the throat and burned the lungs. Swarms of bidrifts, small birds with
    oily skin, interrupted their preparations for the Patra and flew to the
    north hills. Rodents, or what looked like rodents to Stringer, found their
    way up the ramps and stairs to Ta-tjenen's citadel, crowding the streets
    already overflowing with people and sharing their food. The fire, damp wood
    or no, found plenty of fuel in the forest and left a charred trail of tree
    stumps and ashes as it worked its way south to the cities near the edge of
    the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer stood with Taljen and Benjfold some kilometers south of
    Ta-tjenen. Their faces were covered with grime, their clothes ripped and
    limbs bruised. Choking on the bitter smoke that cut through his lungs,
    Stringer continually brushed back the ashes that were falling into his
    eyes. He had just felled a tree while helping to clear a fire channel and
    almost toppled back, exhausted. He sat down on the felled trunk and watched
    a small animal run past, tripping over itself in a frantic effort to escape
    the heat and flames.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hundreds of people had spread out, trying to clear the channel. Stringer
    heard a scream and turned just in time to see a group of fire fighters lost
    behind a new wall of flame.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">We're losing,</q> said Benjfold. <q
    ab:speaker="Benjfold">It moves fast, Stringer, very fast, and is now far
    south. Tell me,</q> he continued, sitting down beside Stringer, <q
    ab:speaker="Benjfold">did you bring this upon us?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The question was asked so matter-of-factly that Stringer would not have
    gotten angry even if he were less exhausted. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, I
    didn't. Believe me if you want, don't if you don't.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Well, this is the Golun-Patra.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So I've heard.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">What do you think we should do now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer sighed, paused, and cocked his head. There was a spark in his
    eye. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Is there any way of getting far south, way
    past the fire, far enough so that we have time to clear a great area?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">We could take the boats and sail down the coast
    for a beclad and start work there. But this is a dangerous time of Bannk to
    be going far, I can tell you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you have any choice?</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The boats set sail within a quarter of a beclad. Ta-tjenen had several
    hundred fishing boats at its docks, and they were quickly loaded with
    whatever firefighting equipment could be found. Benjfold had decided to
    lead the contingent south, while Taljen would do what she could near
    Ta-tjenen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen caught Stringer by the arm as he left Uslid's house with a sack
    slung over his shoulder.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You are going, Stringer.</q> It was not a question.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes,</q> he said, hardly looking back.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I don't think you intend to return. I saw your eyes
    at the mention of Glintz the other beclad in the tent.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, I'm glad to hear it is far, but not too
    far. What would you have done in my position? Thanks for everything you've
    done.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen's voice rose to its upper range, the high, piercing upper range that
    could shatter eardrums. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I've done nothing more for
    you, Alien, than I would have done for any Tjenen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">All right, have it your way: thanks for
    nothing.</q> Stringer found Benjfold, and they made their way down the
    winding street to the outer walls, which intersected the westbound shore
    road. Stringer kicked away the rodents that got in his path.
  </p>

  <p>
    The piers were not large, having been made for small boats. Choosing the
    smallest boat of the dozens that he could see, Stringer climbed in,
    throwing his sack over the bow before him. Benjfold followed and took the
    tiller.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wind was a strong and steady southerly, never shifting much farther
    than southeast. Stringer had hoped the trip would be a delight. But
    Stringer wasn't delighted. There were the waves that swelled and troughed,
    leaving huge valleys for the toy boats to vanish in. To his right, the only
    scenery was burned-out forest, an occasional flame visible through gray
    clouds and soot. On his left, the sun was streaked not only by the heavy
    clouds but by the dirty smoke that crept across the sea and flattened over
    the horizon.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer leaned over the boat's edge when he dared and stared at the beach
    for telclads on end. The water pounded hard, but every few hours it seemed
    as if the whole level on the each would rise and fall. It was the only
    thing that convinced Stringer that they were moving at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    A beclad or two later, the boats pulled in permanently to shore, and the
    Tjenens began to disembark and head for the clearing. Stringer thought
    their group a ridiculously puny gesture, especially with the rains due to
    arrive any moment. But now he didn't care.
  </p>

  <p>
    He waited until everyone had left the boat except Benjfold, who seemed to
    be waiting for him to make the first move. Stringer obliged.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Don't wait for me,</q> he said, drawing his
    graser.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">What are you doing?</q> Benjfold asked with a calm
    that betrayed an expectation of the action.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Taking the boat south.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The reply was unexpected. <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Can you sail it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It's small enough. I'm no sailor, but I'll
    manage. I'll have to. The wind is with me, and Glintz shouldn't be
    impossible to reach by any means.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Do you know where it is?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">South. Seventeen or eighteen hundred
    kilometers from here, I would guess.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">The trip is dangerous and will be easier with
    two.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why should you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">You have helped us during the fire. I'll help you
    now. Let me tell someone to take charge while I'm gone.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They set sail in short order. Even so, they could see a doubly clouded
    northern sky and could almost hear the crackling of the flames and taste the
    bitter smoke.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some hours or telclads later, Stringer fell asleep and Benjfold took over
    the sailing alone. The next thing Stringer saw was a cockeyed view of the
    boat tumbling away and water engulfing him. He coughed, spat, and struggled
    to stay on the surface. The boat was out of reach and gliding quickly away
    from him. Stringer pulled out his graser and fired at Benjfold's head but
    missed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Do you think I'd visit you on Glintz?</q> Benjfold
    shouted as he steered the boat around, angling it out to sea. <q
    ab:speaker="Benjfold">But here, Polkraitz Murderer, survive on this!</q>
    Benjfold hurled Stringer's plastic sack overboard and it bobbed up and down
    on the water. Stringer swam for the sack and tied it around his arm.
  </p>

  <p>
    The boat was much too far now to overtake. Stringer swam instead for the
    shore, which was maybe a half-kilometer away. He dragged himself up on the
    beach, sack trailing behind him, and collapsed. His clothing, drenched and
    heavy, did not dry quickly, not now in late Bannk, and he was left
    shivering in the dirty wind.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Eight</div>The Treasure Chest</h2>

  <p>
    The walls of Massarat towered above them, dull gray shadowed with black. As
    they rode through the giant cleft that cut almost due west through the
    mountain, Pike slowed his grask to a loping walk. He looked behind him and
    saw only Paddelack and Barbalan in his wake. A large sigh escaped from his
    lungs and he smiled. <q ab:speaker="Pike">The Gostum will think twice
    before tangling with us again. I'm sure of that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack laughed with a scowl. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Don't be. We had
    surprise, weapons they had never seen—and one of them on our side. And
    still it was lucky. But you're right; they will remember us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike took the bend that led to the east end of the gorge. All at once the
    walls lost their dullness as flecks of granite and mica gleamed in the rays
    of the sun shining directly before them. Pike shielded his eyes; his shadow
    trailed behind him, providing cover for Barbalan. Now he could see
    <em>Number Two</em> ahead of them. The shuttle seemed undisturbed, exactly
    as they had left it more than two unmeasured weeks before.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he neared the edge of the plateau, where the shuttle was resting, he
    saw something that at first he could not believe. His thoughts flashed back
    to the great desert he had seen from Konndjlan. There he had no scale, no
    way to judge distance; now he had one. He was looking at the ocean. The
    only reason he knew it was the ocean was because of the change of color at
    the indistinct coastline. Nearer, the color became greener, more so as the
    mountain began, and then less so as the altitude increased. Farther, the
    water merged with the clouds at an invisible horizon. Paddelack had told
    him that the ocean was two hundred kilometers distant, and now he was
    seeing—how many times that far? There was really no way to tell; the sight
    was incredibly foreshortened and all perspective nonexistent. Thus his
    scale was incomplete. Once again Pike raised his fist at Patra-Bannk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike dismounted and Barbalan did likewise, but Paddelack stayed upon his
    grask. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I'm going to round up a tender for the
    animals,</q> he said. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Be back shortly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Hurry up!</q> Pike shouted as his companion gathered
    the reins of the grask and led the animals toward the cleft. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">In you go,</q> he continued to Barbalan as he opened the
    hatch and motioned to the door. Inside, he sat her down at one of the
    consoles, found a pack of liet nuts, opened it, and held out a handful for
    her. She took them and chewed quietly. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Let me see that
    shoulder of yours.</q> No response. Pike took a knife from storage and cut
    away the ragged material. <q ab:speaker="Pike">That's quite a cut you've
    got there,</q> he said, applying the ultracleaner to the wound. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">But don't worry, I've fixed a few wounds in my time.</q>
    Pike unconsciously ran his thumb down the scar on his own face, then took
    the optical suture from its cabinet.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">It's too bad we can't talk to each other,</q> he
    said. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'd like to talk to you. You're quite a woman,
    do you know that? Probably not, I'd say. You don't even realize I'm telling
    you this.</q> Pike sighed. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well, this should do
    you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack climbed in at the moment with the boy Mith clinging to his
    shirt. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Looks like you've patched her up pretty
    well. She'll heal quickly; everyone around here does…you should've seen the
    folks back there when I came in. <q>You escaped from Konndjlan!</q> they
    said. <q>Both of us and another,</q> I said back. <q>Remarkable!
    Impossible! The same man who cleared the path?…</q></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">So the Gostum aren't the only ones who will remember
    us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You're absolutely right. They wanted to feast us
    again, but I told them we were in a hurry.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Good. Well, are you ready?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Ready for what, exactly?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike did not answer but instead made a check of the message records. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">There is nothing here from Valyavar and Stringer, it
    seems.…No beacon, either.…<em>Crimson</em>, come in. Stringer, Val, are you
    there?…On board message recorder, anything?…</q> Pike turned around. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Nothing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Will you search?</q> asked Paddelack.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Search where? The whole planet? And after weeks of
    being out of touch? They could be anywhere. No, we won't search. It seems
    that we are on our own.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Still plan on going to Daryephna? Don't ask me to
    show you the way. I doubt I could hit it closer than twenty-five thousand
    kilometers; it's been a long time.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike smiled, took the Gostum map from his hood, and unfolded it on the
    cabin floor. A corner ripped where the dead guard's blood had glued it
    together. Pike pointed his finger at the spot he guessed to be Massarat,
    then moved it northeast across the expanse of blue that rent a large gap
    between two continents. At a large symbol, his finger stopped. Nothing else
    was near the mark, clearly the most prominent point on that half of the
    map.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack nodded with a sigh. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You guessed
    right. That one's Daryephna. Those few others? Who knows? Ink drops,
    maybe.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan winced at the one word in her own language.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You see, it does mean something to these
    people.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What? Would you tell me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack relayed the message to the girl.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">There is a story,</q> Barbalan replied, <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">that when the Polkraitz left Patra-Bannk, they stored
    their greatest treasure in Daryephna. They vowed to return and collect it
    in some future beclad, but to prevent anyone from taking it, they put a
    curse on the city. That is why no one other than Polkraitz can enter.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">When will they return?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan glanced at Pike standing above her. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Some
    say during the Golun-Patra. And this is the twelfth Golun-Patra.</q> When
    Pike heard this he laughed, but Barbalan calmly continued. <q
    ab:speaker="Benjfold">However, the Gostum are a practical people, if
    nothing else, unlike their Liddlefuran neighbors. We are not going to wait
    forever for the Polkraitz and are finding other ways to survive—or to leave
    Patra-Bannk, if that is possible.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Which brings us to the Trieskan rockets. Tell me, does
    she really believe that the Trieskans are building rockets? If their
    technology is at the same level that we saw at Konndjlan, then you must
    know that is impossible. Even Jedoval would never try to make up a story
    like that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Once again Barbalan answered through Paddelack. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">Does it really matter?</q> She shrugged. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">If they are building anything that will improve the
    life of my people, we should know about it, don't you think? Life on
    Patra-Bannk is difficult. If rockets are being built that would take us to
    another world, then it would be worth risking our lives. Even if they
    haven't built them yet but have the Polkraitz plans, it would be worth
    it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What does she mean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">The largest Polkraitz camp was originally at
    Triesk. Maybe they left plans or rockets there and the Trieskans have
    figured them out.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike smiled. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Now we are beginning to get a more
    reasonable story. Have you tried asking them for help?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I have been told the attempt was made but
    failed. Gostum and Trieskans long ago were friends, but since almost as
    long, enemies. That is why, when you were seen at Massarat, you were taken
    to Konndjlan. It was thought you might help.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Which brings us full circle: if they want help, they
    must know what is going on one hundred thousand kilometers away. How? That
    is a nontrivial distance even by our standards.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan spoke in her calm voice after Paddelack translated Pike's
    question. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I am not one of the Fairtalian, and
    therefore not privileged to know how the information is obtained. I have
    heard that even the Fairtalian do not understand the process and that the
    method is magic.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">So that's that,</q> grunted Pike, popping a liet nut
    into his mouth. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Once magic is invoked, I don't think
    there is anything that I can say about it, is there?</q> He yawned. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Get us a course to Daryephna. Remember to stop at the
    <em>Crimson</em> for refueling. Will you do that, Paddy?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">First I want to show you something.</q> Paddelack
    sat down in the pilot's position. Despite twenty-odd years without
    practice, he proved himself to be a good pilot, and soon they were
    off. Within a few minutes they broke through the lower clouds and passed
    the old settlement Hendig had shown Pike earlier. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Do you know why that settlement's deserted?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No,</q> Pike said. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Hendig said it
    wasn't his bronze.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Not mine, either. I do have a guess. You've
    noticed how hot it is on Patra-Bannk. That means the atmosphere is very
    high, breathable to a great altitude. Suppose somebody went up there, found
    the temperature to his liking, and started a settlement. Then night
    comes. Gets so cold that atmosphere shrinks and collapses. Everyone dies
    because there is no air. That's my theory, but I don't know much about that
    stuff, so shoot it full of holes if you want.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">An interesting theory,</q> Pike said. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Well, I'm going to get some sleep. It's been a long
    day.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    At first it looked as if it might be just a mountain peak beyond the distant
    horizon. That was a good theory if the fact that the peak stood alone was
    not allowed to disturb you. Nonetheless, it was difficult to be sure; the
    sun reflected off the crystal water and off the approaching land,
    whitewashing detail with its glancing rays. Even after Pike had first
    noticed it, a long hour by the ship's clock passed before the solitary
    structure rose beneath them. But long before then it was clear they had
    found Daryephna.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike was pleased with himself; after all, he had only lost the rest of the
    crew, and only one was definitely dead. The others might yet turn up, and
    this was the most likely spot to find them. So there was no point in
    worrying yet. Even the episode at Konndjlan had proved useful. Had it not
    provided the map that led them almost directly to Daryephna? Directly
    enough so that finding it had been the equivalent of only a few days'
    work. Most importantly, the escape from the fortress would add immeasurably
    to the story he would tell when he returned to Two-Bit. Yes, on the whole,
    the mission was progressing most satisfactorily.
  </p>

  <p>
    Daryephna stood alone on a plain of green that was uninterrupted but for a
    few low hills and rivers. Pike guided <em>Number Two</em> over the city, if
    that was the correct word for the solid structure that swept up below
    them. Whoever had built it had appreciated the highly symmetrical. The
    perimeter of Daryephna traced out a diamond with concave sides, each
    several kilometers long. From the corners of the diamond the four major
    arms of the city spiraled inward, intertwining as they rose to the central
    peak. Minor arms were interlaced between the larger arms and also merged
    into one at the center. Pike could not decide whether it was magnificent or
    ugly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Having chosen a landing site between two of the spiral arms, Pike took
    <em>Number Two</em> downward. They descended slowly, carefully.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly Barbalan screamed and clasped her head between her hands. She bent
    to her knees with a contorted face and looked as if she would vomit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What's happening to her?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">It's the Fear setting in. Take her up, man! Can't
    you see she's in agony? Take us up!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, you're right, absolutely,</q> Pike responded
    quickly but confusedly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack knelt by Barbalan. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Are you all right
    now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The young woman nodded. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">You seemed like
    jelly. Nothing was straight. Everything went dim.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">That's all right. We'll fly elsewhere.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike flew kilometer or so out and landed there, this time with one eye on
    the controls and the other on Barbalan. When they were solidly on the
    ground, Pike asked, <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Did you feel anything,
    Paddelack?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Not a thing. Never did last time I was here,
    either. Nothing at all. That's what I told you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I remember your story. I didn't feel anything,
    either. I must admit it is curious, curious indeed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack glanced at Barbalan. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">What will we do
    with her? We can't take her inside.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Then obviously she has to stay here. That's clear,
    wouldn't you say?</q> Pike began arming himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Won't need those, you can be sure of that. No one
    is here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">We'll see. You can come with me or stay with her.</q>
    Pike jumped out of the shuttle without waiting for an answer and was
    greeted by the hot Bannk wind.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">We'll be back later,</q> Paddelack explained to
    Barbalan, showing her where food was stored. Then he too hurried to exit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike walked along on one of the spiral arms as it gradually wound its way
    inward to the center of the giant rise. There was entrance at the central
    juncture, simply an archway cut into the gray walls. There was nothing to
    be seen on the inside. As far as Pike could tell, everything was completely
    black.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You're hesitating,</q> Paddelack called, out of
    breath, from behind him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'm not—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">If one finds himself at a gateway,</q> his
    companion said in a wheedling voice, <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">what should
    one do but go through it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    With that, Pike sucked in his breath and stepped forward. Inside, it was
    light, bright, clean, an almost fluorescent white with a hint of blue
    bouncing off the tentlike walls. Pike could not discover the source of the
    illumination. When he had been outside, the inside had appeared totally
    dark, pitch-black. Had something switched on when he entered? He hadn't
    noticed anything. Was it a clever illusion? What illusion? Pike walked
    forward, expecting his footsteps to echo loudly. But there was no sound
    other than that which directly reached his ears. Dead? Anechoic? Pike
    jumped up and landed hard. Now he heard something off a far wall. That was
    better. <q ab:speaker="Pike" ab:filter="reverb">Hello!</q> he shouted,
    cupping his hands to his mouth. Again there was not a great echo, just a
    slight reverberation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Whom do you expect to find? Your grandfather?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No, just testing, just trying to get a feel for the
    place.</q> Pike walked over to the wall and ran his hand across the smooth
    surface. <q ab:speaker="Pike">You know, I think we are expected,
    welcome.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack pinched his nose. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I don't feel anything
    of the sort. If you want to be Sarek and steal Ostlan's Vase, that's fine
    with me, but don't be surprised when the Bentagen attack.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'll keep that in mind.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">About the only thing I can say for this place is
    that it is at a reasonable room temperature—if I could remember what a
    reasonable temperature was.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack was right; Daryephna did seem to be pleasantly insulated against
    the impossible outside world.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Now that we're here, what should we look for,
    would you mind telling me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Anything unusual—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Oh, come on,</q> Paddelack laughed. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">you'll have to do better than that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'm particularly interested in the metal that Hendig
    showed you. If you have any, let me know immediately.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Why? What's so important about that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Just curious, that's all.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Ten light-years to be curious? I can think of
    other ways of satisfying my curiosity.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Patience, my dear Paddelack, patience.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Most rooms contained nothing. In others there were banks of forms that
    might have been taken for controls of some sort, but if they were controls,
    they were certainly not for humans and, in any case, certainly not
    functional. This left Pike and Paddelack wondering if they were controls at
    all. Chairs and sofas were to be found in some of the larger chambers, but
    they were all too big and slightly out of shape. Almost everything in
    Daryephna seemed slightly out of shape; straight lines or simple curves
    didn't seem popular. The overall impression was one of utter desertion,
    quickly and thoroughly done.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What do you make of all this?</q> Pike asked as they
    sat in a green park from which a ramp spiraled to heights yet unexplored.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Well,</q> Paddelack replied, <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">since it has webbed feet, it can't be an eagle.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike squinted at his companion, who was sitting on the turf. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">What do you mean by that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You look at a curved wall and ask, why is that a
    curved wall and not a straight one? You see a ramp instead of a staircase
    and wonder, why is that a ramp? Why is the metal this color? Why is the
    light source hidden, and why does the light have a peculiar tint? It seems
    to me that whoever built this place was slightly different from us, so they
    built a city that looks slightly different from one we would
    produce. That's all. Why read any more into it?</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    For the first time since they had left Konndjlan, Barbalan found herself
    alone. The Fear had taken care of that, or, more accurately, the feigning
    of the Fear. She had felt nothing whatsoever when they neared Daryephna,
    but after many of Paddelack's stories and his assurances that she would be
    attacked, she thought that playacting was the best thing to do.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides, now she was alone, and that was what she wanted at the moment. Now
    she could concentrate her attention on the necklace that she had kept
    hidden from the others. The chain was heavy metal, the links forged and
    welded. She could barely slide it over her head, but she did, and that
    might prove be a good thing in the future. The pendant. The secret must be
    there. Barbalan fingered the thick disk, engraved on all sides: fire,
    rockets, helmets, spears. The workmanship was detailed, but that did not
    interest Barbalan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Were the symbols a code? The hieroglyphics were standard Gostum symbols
    representing Polkraitz, Fairtalian, Gostum. No, Barbalan decided, the
    symbols were not a code.
  </p>

  <p>
    A telclad or so later, she managed to open the pendant, when she discovered
    that by pressing the sun figure, the disk could then be unscrewed into two
    halves. Inside the bottom half was a needle that pointed almost due west: a
    compass, of course, but Barbalan had never seen one before. Inside the top
    half was a circular card that fell out when she turned that half of the
    pendant over. That annoyed Barbalan; she was getting tired of
    maps. Konndjlan was clearly marked, and fifty kilometers or so away was
    marked the stala. The stala; what did that mean? The root of the word was
    <q>carry.</q> The suffix didn't make grammatical sense, unless it was
    shorthand for phrase endings. Maybe <q>how to carry?</q> Barbalan looked up
    and the answer was clear. The stala were how the Fairtalian got to the
    other Gostum headquarters. And the map simply showed the way to the stala
    nearest Konndjlan. There were even directions that showed how to use the
    needle to find the way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan turned the map over to find a list:
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr><td>Stala-Konndjlan</td><td>1,4</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Stala-Sect</td><td>2,9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Stala-Pant</td><td>3,2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Stala-Triesk</td><td>4,9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Stala-Forbidden Elsewhere</td><td>4,8</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Stala-Forbidden Elsewhere</td><td>5,3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>……………</td><td>…</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    There were less than two dozen entries. Barbalan recognized the names of
    several Gostum headquarters. She had even been taken to Pant once,
    blindfolded, since she was not yet Fairtalian. Obviously, the stala had
    been the method. But what did <q>1,4</q> mean? Barbalan had no idea. She
    closed the pendant up tight. She felt half Fairtalian.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    On the third trip into Daryephna Pike made his first real discovery. He had
    almost given up hope of finding anything remotely intelligible in the city;
    so much of what they had seen made little or no sense. Here it was a
    skeleton of a city. Under the central peak was a park with a dry fountain
    in its center. Blue-green turf, expertly tended, naturally, covered it,
    walkways crossed it, roads circled it. This central atrium dissolved into
    doorways, archways, ramps, and concourses that led to places already
    explored and places unknown. Pike started each search from this central
    park. He walked kilometers upon kilometers, found rooms, many locked, many
    open, none very enlightening. He began to realize that it would take
    months, if not years, to make a thorough search. He was almost ready to
    give up and take his leave, as Hendig must have been about to do twenty
    years earlier. But Hendig <em>had</em> found something. Paddelack had seen
    it; so had Pike. In this skeleton of a city something was to be found.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike's mind was fairly blank as he approached the end of a walkway
    overlooking a large lobbylike area. The wall before him had seemed a dead
    end until the corridor opened to one side and the lights beyond offered
    their cool greeting. The chamber was immense, curving away in all
    directions to unresolvable distance. The room was so big Pike thought it
    must be a rocket hangar. He wandered. It was not long before he noticed
    rectangular shapes of various heights far opposite him. It took ten minutes
    to get close; even interior distances were deceiving on Freeze-Bake. By
    then he could see that the rectangles were stacks of large plates, flat,
    frosty gray. He walked over to the closest, which stood waist-high, and
    tried to lift the top plate. It came up easily in his hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was metallic hydrogen. The color was right, a little whiter than
    magnesium and, of course, the lightest metal he had ever handled. Pike
    dropped the sheet and a <em>whoosh</em> of air shot out as it landed on the
    stack with a thud. Then he went to Paddelack to gloat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack admitted his defeat. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">All right, I'm
    impressed; you found the stuff here just waiting for you, your quest is
    ended. Now would you mind telling me what you were trying to find?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'm sorry I didn't mention it earlier, but I didn't
    want to turn out a fool. Do you know what this material is?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Well, I remember that Hendig showed me his
    piece. It was very light, but that's all I know.</q> Paddelack picked up a
    sheet, just as Pike had before, and dropped it. <em>Whoosh.</em> <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Yeah, this is the same stuff.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Metallic hydrogen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack whistled.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You know something about it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack was annoyed. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I was an engineer,
    remember, even if a bad one. Give me credit for once having known
    something.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Then tell me, if you have metallic hydrogen, what
    would you do with it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack's eyes lit up and he hopped on top of the stack. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">What would I do with it? Why, I'd transform the
    world! Do you realize what this is? A room-temperature
    superconductor. Lossless transmission lines and electrical wiring. Do you
    realize just how much electrical power is lost in the wiring? An incredible
    fraction. This stuff would end all that, save billions of quintens. You
    could get rid of that lousy liquid helium, too, you wouldn't need it. Train
    tracks? Levitate your trains. We do that already, but with that sloppy
    liquid helium. Giant accelerators to ring the world, if you want them. And
    if it's strong enough, what a building material! Lighter than anything
    else! And, by Sarek, if it's cheap enough to make, it's
    inexhaustible. Hydrogen only makes up half the Universe. Sarek, I'm sorry I
    doubted you. This is a find! We'll be rich. What a thought! Maybe my twenty
    years here will have amounted to something!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike nodded. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I thought it was worth the trip. But,</q>
    he said, looking around, <q ab:speaker="Pike">is there more? As amazing as
    the substance is, it isn't enough to change a civilization, is it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack swiveled around from atop his perch and surveyed the
    storeroom. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Not even enough to make us rich.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'd rather change a civilization, wouldn't you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Hah. All I care about is getting off this planet
    with enough to keep me comfortable for my trouble.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike grinned. <q ab:speaker="Pike">You are a rather sleazy character. You'd
    team up with anyone to be high and dry, wouldn't you? Liddlefurans, me,
    Gostum, anybody. I'd say you'd betray your own brother to get yourself off
    this improbable world—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Why you—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">One would never guess that you were so desperate from
    your cocky manner of speech. A good hiding place, words, don't you
    agree?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly Paddelack's eyes lost their new-found glimmer and he spat on the
    floor. He knelt down on top of the stack until he was staring straight into
    Pike's eyes. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Look, man, you have no idea of what
    it is like to live on Patra-Bannk for more than twenty years. To wake up
    day after day and not be sure the sun has moved a centimeter. To wish time
    would fly and carry your life nearer to its end, but only to have the sun
    sit there and laugh, dragging you along minute by agonizing minute. Do you
    know what it is to pound your fist on a door for months on end just to be
    allowed to breathe real air, and at the same time to know that if that door
    opened, you'd be frozen solid in a second? Worst of all, to realize that
    all hope is gone, all hope that you'll <em>ever</em> get off. Just because
    of one fool minute when this damned planet decided to play a trick on you
    and you weren't looking. It gnaws at your stomach for every painful minute
    of every infinitely long day and of every infinitely long night. Man, I
    would sell my soul to get off this planet, make no mistake about that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And the added treasure here makes for slight
    recompense, eh, Paddy?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
     <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Have you never lost all hope?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
     <q ab:speaker="Pike">Never.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Well, then you'll never understand what it means
    to be given a second chance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I make my second chances. And that includes finding
    the manufacturing facility. A good idea, don't you agree?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack nodded. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">A good idea. Let's hope we know
    it when we see it.</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Nine</div>Dialogue on Two World
  Systems</h2>

  <p>
    This was the Weird Bannk, the shortest of all the Bannks, with the shortest
    of all the teclads and those growing shorter still. The sun, never above
    shoulder height this Bannk, was now sinking fast toward the horizon. After
    three months of failing to climb even halfway to the zenith, the
    snail-paced orb had decided to retreat quickly, unhesitatingly,
    monotonically toward the Patra. The temperature of the air in those
    slanting rays followed the curve of the sun, falling with it now, quickly,
    also unhesitatingly, monotonically toward the Patra.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was sure that the sun was now moving so fast that night would come
    at any moment. For a second he cursed his imagination, wishing time would
    fly and carry his life nearer to its end; then he forced himself to
    concentrate on what to do next.
  </p>

  <p>
    He set about collecting wood for a fire. He wasn't sure if he needed one
    yet, but Pike had told him that it was the first thing you did when
    stranded. He ignited the wood with his graser and basked in the added heat
    of the faintly visible daylight flames.
  </p>

  <p>
    He heard a rustle behind him and swiveled around just in time to see a
    small two-legged sauropod scurrying into the woods. He ran after it,
    tripped twice, and cut his arm. He finally caught up with the animal as it
    ducked into a hole in the ground. It shrieked as he killed it with a quick
    blast. Then he felt around in the hole. He couldn't reach to the bottom but
    imagined that it was deeper than the Patra. No wonder, then, that he had
    seen only small animals, except for the grask, brought by the Polkraitz
    themselves. Burrow under for the Patra. Save yourself. Stringer didn't
    think he could fit into the hole, so he stood up and headed back into the
    woods.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the fire, Stringer opened the plastic sack that, thankfully, Benjfold
    had thrown overboard and took out his knife. He began cutting up his catch,
    whose skin smelled strongly of glycerol, into small portions. That done, he
    emptied the sack onto the ground and mounted the bag itself on a tall
    pod-tree branch. If he were lucky, somebody would come by within a
    Patra-Bannk or two and see his frozen body as well as his distress
    signal. Glintz, clearly, was too far to walk to; there was not even a
    chance of his getting there. Would the insulated plastic tent last the
    Patra? Stringer laughed.
  </p>

  <p>
    He finished his dinner, sighed, and glanced at the contents of his sack
    scattered over the ground. He picked up his rodoft, hardly damp thanks to
    the waterproof bag, and began picking at the strings. A dull twang released
    itself. Stringer found the bow lying across his kalan, picked it up, and
    dragged it across the strings. A squawk and a screech pierced the air. He
    sighed again and spread out a fingering chart Uslid had given him. He began
    to sort out the notes, testing the sound at each placement of his
    fingers. That was better. A thirty-one-tone scale. The Tjenens had already
    demonstrated the flexibility of their voices with their sing-song language;
    their ears must be equally sensitive, if not more so, to distinguish the
    close-packed frequencies of the subtle scale. And as another
    <em>screeeech</em> emerged from the sounding gourd, Stringer was sure that
    he would never master it.
  </p>

  <p>
    For hours or telclads, Stringer sat on the beach playing the rodoft. He set
    up the tent, searched for shelter and more food, then went back to playing
    in the open under the cloud-filled sky. That was all he wanted to do. He
    glanced across the water at the dim outline of the sun. The sun was
    laughing at him for sure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The water lapping around his ankle made Stringer conscious of something he
    had noticed on the trip south and earlier on the beach. The impression that
    had continually impinged on his retina and immediately evaporated could now
    be verbalized: the ocean was experiencing tides. Even with the waves, that
    was clear; every few hours the water would creep up on the beach, then
    recede.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer looked up into the sky. But Patra-Bannk had no moon; at least he
    hadn't seen one. Every child knew that tides were produced by the moon. Or
    by the sun. Stringer thought for a moment. No, he didn't think the sun
    explained anything, either. Patra-Bannk rotated so slowly that he doubted
    solar tides would be so easily noticed. So Stringer reasoned against the
    tides and decided he was seeing some other long-term wave phenomenon. At
    least that explanation had the advantage of being untestable, whereas his
    tide theory seemed to be disproved.
  </p>

  <p>
    After watching the water recede, Stringer searched a new area for
    shelter. Finding none, he returned to the beach. The wind wrapped his cowl
    around his neck and distorted the sounds of his rodoft. The wind was not
    always south any more, but was beginning to gust and veer, changing
    direction at whim. Stringer could taste the forest fire moving closer,
    borne on that wind, and he remembered that his was not the only life in
    danger.
  </p>

  <p>
    As he sat there bowing the rodoft, he felt the first drops of rain whipping
    into his face. It had rained once or twice at Ta-tjenen, but now it was
    late Bannk, so this must be the start of the late-Bannk rains that Taljen
    has mentioned. Bad weather was on its way, and the bad weather would not
    let us before Bannk's end. Stringer went back to his instrument.
  </p>

  <p>
    He wasn't sure what made him look up at the precise instant that he did,
    but he was sure that if he hadn't, it would have been too late. Oars
    dipping into the water, a ship was making its way north, straining against
    both wind and waves. Stringer jumped up and shouted:
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Here! Here!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    He plucked his bag from the pod-tree and waved it high above his head. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Here! Can you see me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The ship wasn't far off shore and Stringer was quickly spotted. In a few
    minutes, after some trouble in the surf, the craft had beached
    itself. Stringer gathered up his things and ran to the small vessel.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="oarsman">This is a strange place to be near Bannk's end,</q>
    said one of the oarsmen as he helped Stringer over the edge.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It's a strange place to be at any time,</q>
    Stringer answered.
  </p>

  <p>
    The oarsman was tall and dark, with face almost the same shade as
    hair. Stringer knew what that meant.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="oarsman">You speak with an accent. Where are you from?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Far away…very far away. Tell me where you are
    going.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="oarsman">Back to the Center. Where else is there to go?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded heavily, and the boat once again took to the water. They
    tacked the coast, angling in and out like a sewing needle, doing their best
    to avoid sailing into the wind. It was a long process, and the ten oarsmen
    did not seem to help greatly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer watched the sail for a moment and then stretched out on the
    deck. He slept soundly for the first time since the start of the fire. He
    was awakened by heavier drops of rain falling on his face than those he had
    felt before. He got up and turned to the cabin.
  </p>

  <p>
    
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="oarsman">You can't go down there,</q> said the same oarsman.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why not?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="oarsman">The Time Keeper is hard at work.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer balked, but only for a moment. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I think he
    would like to see me.</q> He pushed the other aside and opened the cabin
    door. Two or three steps down, he entered a room that was cluttered with
    parchment lying on the floor and scattered over the single desk. On that
    desk was a blank white ball with some black marks scribbled over its
    surface.
  </p>

  <p>
    A short little man with silvery hair and very black eyes paced the cabin,
    kicking up the papers with his shuffle.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Come in! Come in! I thank you. Who are you? Come
    in!</q> the man continually exclaimed with a squeak in his voice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer stepped forward. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">My name is Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You are not from Ta-tjenen or Glintz, no, that is
    obvious.</q> The silver-haired man studied Stringer closely.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, I'm not.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Good, then maybe you will listen to me. I have made
    a great discovery. The results are here. I have made runs in previous
    Bannks, but no one listens. So I did it again and again. I still have to
    compare these figures with those taken at Ta-tjenen this Mid-Bannk. But I
    am sure—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What have you found out?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">The world is round!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Spherical? Like a ball?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Precisely as this one here. Isn't that exciting?</q>
    The little man chuckled in obvious delight.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer leaned against the wall and sighed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I
    thought I was mad when I told Taljen and she wouldn't believe me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You <em>know</em> already?</q> The silver-haired
    man's voice betrayed disappointment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I am not from this world but
    another. I knew already. But don't worry, the discovery is still yours.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The older man smiled. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I thank you. An Alien, that is
    interesting. Polkraitz?</q> He studied Stringer closely again.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do I look like one?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I wouldn't know. But you say you have talked to
    Taljen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You know her?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes, of course—very well, in fact. Who in Ta-tjenen
    doesn't know her?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That seems to be true.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But she was my assistant also and should have been
    taking measurements for me while I was gone. Was she?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't know. She may have been. For the first
    teclad I was there, I was not very conscious of what she was doing. You
    mentioned Mid-Bannk. I arrived after that, about a teclad after, I
    think. But it is good to know that I am not crazy. How stupid can Ta-tjenen
    be, not to realize that the world is a ball? Taljen just couldn't believe
    me—or you, I guess.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">This has been a standing argument between us and has
    gotten to the point where she doesn't like to talk about it at all. But, I
    ask you, why should Taljen believe you or me? She is a bright girl and
    believes what she sees. Why should she listen to us? If you lived on this
    planet all your life, what would make you believe it wasn't flat?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer gave his standard answer: <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Ships on my
    world gradually sink below the horizon. That wouldn't happen on a flat
    world. They would fall off and suddenly disappear.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">True. But do you think you could see this ship on
    the horizon? Not unless you had eyes like a solofar. We usually don't
    travel that far, anyway.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why not?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Where is there to go but fishing? Glintz is the
    closest town to Ta-tjenen, and that is almost two thousand kilometers, and
    we have just come from Godrhan, the next town, twice as far as
    that. Besides, the Bannks are hot and the wind is usually south. Sailing
    back north is cumbersome; that is why we tried coming back now, when the
    wind shifts to the south-east. However, I see we may have waited too
    long.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Hasn't anyone sailed around the world?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Stringer,</q> the silver-haired man chuckled, <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">are you serious? With the heat of Mid-Bannk and the
    Patra, and the size—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, I suppose that was silly. I had
    forgotten. Didn't your Polkraitz leave any records? Maps?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Not that I know of. Any more questions?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Hmmm.</q> Stringer thought for a moment. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Once somebody told me that you can see the roundness
    of other planets and the—</q> For the first time Stringer realized that the
    Tjenens had no word for <q>moon.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you see any other planets?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well,</q> sighed Stringer, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">it looks as if the right thing to ask is, why do you
    believe the world is round?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">A good question, and it took me a long time to be
    convinced of it, I'll not tell you wrongly. I'll show you the first
    evidence that got me thinking.</q> The old man ducked under the table and
    brushed away some of the parchments lying about, to reveal a metal box
    about half a meter long, handsomely made of brass or something very
    similar. He motioned Stringer to the door, and they went above, taking the
    box with them.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Ah, it's raining, and the sun has begun to put on
    fur. But it isn't fully clothed yet, for the moment, and we might still see
    something. Look here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer peered through the hole that was cut into one side of the box and
    saw an image of the cloud-streaked sun projected along an inner wall.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you see those little black specks on the sun?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded, barely making out a single sun-spot.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I keep a record of their positions. They travel
    across the sun. The bigger ones I can see get distorted, disappear around
    the edge, and in less than an average teclad come around to the other
    side. The sun, at least, acts like a ball, don't you think?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer thought that was clever. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you have any
    other evidence?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes,</q> said the little man with that curious
    squeak in his voice. <q ab:speaker="Alhane" class="no-close-quote">After all, I
    thought that if the sun was a ball, maybe the world was too. But I couldn't
    figure out a way of testing that, and my head ran itself around in
    circles. Finally, one beclad in the market, I spotted my own shadow being
    cast on a rather large melon. The shadows were the key, it came to me in
    that instant. But that was only the beginning. After beclads of
    excruciating thought—and this I can't underestimate—I eventually decided
    that if the world was flat and the sun traveling above it, then the sun's
    rays would strike the ground at the same angle whether you were north or
    south. Indeed, this requires the assumption that the sun is small and far
    away and that the rays can be considered parallel. You might object that I
    have no justification for making that assumption unless I know how far away
    the sun is—which I don't—and I would say you're right. Nonetheless, it was
    the simplest assumption to make—I would agree with that myself, and
    somebannk when all the answers are in, I am sure I will be borne out.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane" class="no-close-quote">On the other hand, and under the
    same assumption, if the world was curved then the angle of the sun would
    change depending on where you were. It took me a long time to figure that
    out; after all, I'm no geometer, am I not? My father was more the
    mathematical type but I hate the stuff. Does it, I ask you, give you any
    feel for real things? Have you ever seen a perfect triangle in nature? Or a
    semi-infinite half plane? Geometry is really very fictitious, especially if
    the world truly is a ball. In that case, I ask you further, does it make
    any sense to talk about plane geometry at all? Certainly not. You can't
    make real triangles on a sphere. Whoever invented plane geometry was living
    in a world of his own.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Anyway, not to digress, this was all four or five
    Bannks ago. What I did then was to take two big rods like so</q>—the Time
    Keeper held his arms outstretched—<q ab:speaker="Alhane"
    class="no-close-quote">and go out onto the beach with an assistant. We planted
    the first rod in the sand, making sure that it was quite straight, and then
    I ran down the beach with the second rod, doing the same thing. At my
    signal we both measured the length of the shadow cast by the sun. To my
    profound disappointment, I'll be truthful on that, we saw no difference in
    the lengths of the shadows. Absolutely none. At first I thought that the
    world was surely flat but, after some thought, I decided to try bigger
    poles. We repeated the experiment, hoping that taller posts would make the
    difference in shadow lengths easier to see. The only result was that I got
    tired from running up and down the beach. Finally, and this was a curious
    thought, I conjectured that perhaps the world was bigger than I had
    expected, and so I sailed down the coast for a few dozens of kilometers. We
    thought we could trust our clocks for that short amount of time to make
    sure we took the readings at the same instant, although, on afterthought,
    that turned out not to be so crucial; the sun does move very slowly, as you
    can see. So we did it. Again nothing. There was absolutely nothing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane" class="no-close-quote">By this time, you can be sure that
    I was about to give up the whole project. However, I was possessed by the
    idea and vowed to go all the way to Glintz the next Bannk. Now, I shan't
    tell you falsely that no one ever goes to Glintz, especially just to
    measure shadows. So I got a number of rods—taking many poles and averaging
    data would offer more reasonable results, don't you agree?—and left some
    behind at Ta-tjenen and sailed south to Glintz. Because our clocks wouldn't
    be useful after such a journey, we were especially careful to get there
    before Mid-Bannk, when we would take most of the readings. When we got back
    to Ta-tjenen, my assistants and I compared measurements. Once again I felt
    my heart freezing, because the first readings taken on the way south showed
    nothing definite. Oh, there were small differences in shadow lengths,
    hardly readable, I tell you, but some showed the longer shadow on the
    northern pole and some showed it on the southern. And I'm afraid it can't
    be both at once, whether the world is flat or round.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Finally we reached the measurements taken at Glintz
    itself. Again, on the shorter poles where reading anything is difficult,
    only small random fluctuations showed up. At last, on most of the taller
    poles we got results that were big enough to be read, and some of those
    agreed as closely as might be expected. It wasn't much to go on, but enough
    to convince me. It convinced no one else, I can tell you that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why not?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane" class="no-close-quote">Ah, Stringer Not of Ta-tjenen,
    when I got my results back and showed them around, people said, <q>Why,
    that's only a few centimeters' difference in the length of a shadow, not
    even a finger's length. And if your measurements were not made at the same
    time, then everything is meaningless. And of course, you have no way of
    telling that the measurements were made at the same time.</q></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane" class="no-close-quote">And I replied, <q>No, you're quite
    wrong. That's why we took lots of measurements at Mid-Bannk, when the sun
    was moving the slowest—and that is very slow indeed. Certainly, by taking
    measurements every few belclads, we could be sure to find the shortest
    shadow, even through the haze if we were lucky, indicating that the
    measurement was taken precisely at Mid-Bannk.</q> And then I went on to
    explain that we wanted <em>local</em> Mid-Bannk wherever we were, be it
    Glintz or Ta-tjenen, and it didn't matter if the two towns were directly
    north or south, which would make the Mid-Bannks at the same time. This went
    totally over their heads, and I gave up trying to explain it to them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane" class="no-close-quote">Still, they wouldn't be
    silenced. <q>And how do you know how far it is to Glintz?</q> they
    asked. <q>You can't measure the distance with a ruler; you can only guess
    at it from your travel times and estimated speeds. What if you're
    wrong?</q></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane" class="no-close-quote"><q>That,</q> I replied, <q>would
    only change the size of the world and not the shape, so your objection is
    irrelevant.</q></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No sooner had I made this devastating rebuttal than
    they raised the objection that the measuring pole had to be perfectly
    vertical or the results would be wrong. Was that ever dirt in the eyes!
    When I calculated the error that a slightly tilted pole would cause, and
    estimated the accuracy with which I could make a pole vertical by eye, I
    realized that the experiment was at best questionable, at worst totally
    useless. In fact, I am sure those random readings and wholesale
    disagreements I spoke of were caused by just this phenomenon: poles tilting
    in the wind. What is even sadder, it seems that by increasing the height of
    the pole to make reading the results easier, one just increases the error
    by the same percentage. So tall poles do not decrease the error, only
    enlarge it along with the <q>true</q> result. Thus, my tall-pole readings
    at Glintz may have simply made my readings of a systematic error more
    accurate, and the world could still be flat.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer could only shake his head now, not in derision, but in the
    realization that he would have given up long before then.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Time Keeper continued: <q ab:speaker="Alhane" class="no-close-quote">I
    resolved to go back to Glintz the next Bannk with better apparatus, which I
    did, making sure that the poles were perfectly vertical, which, to be sure,
    is no mean feat in the wind. To my great and overwhelming satisfaction, I
    got the same results, or close enough. Still, the same objections were
    raised when I returned. After all, would you change the shape of the world
    because one shadow is half a finger longer than another two thousand
    kilometers away?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Well, at this point, I sent a ship out onto the
    ocean and watched it all the while with my telescope, hoping to see it
    sink, which, as you suggest, occurs on your world. I wanted to show the
    others that proof, too. But after looking and seeing little more than a
    blur—and that only if I was being optimistic—I knew I wasn't going to
    convince anybody.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And yet you still believed?</q> Stringer asked in
    admiration.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I did begin to doubt my results again, especially
    when I used them to compute the size of Patra-Bannk. It's two million
    kilometers around! How could I believe it? You ask about sailing around the
    world—and I tried to measure shadows running up and down the beach! What a
    comedy of errors!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But you're right,</q> said Stringer softly.
    However, the old man didn't hear.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">So,</q> the other went on, sighing, <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">nobody believed me and I hardly did, either. When I
    suggested that my theory predicted that the sun would look higher in the
    south and therefore the south should be hotter than Ta-tjenen, just as the
    Long Bannk is hotter than the Short, everyone laughed. That's when I
    decided to take an expedition to Godrhan, which, as I've said, is more than
    twice as far as Glintz. And the angle so measured is more than twice as big
    as the ones I have measured before. I'll bet on that without having seen the
    latest data from Ta-tjenen. Furthermore, as the sun is lowest this Bannk,
    the error due to any pole tilt will be lessened, I will so argue.</q> He
    paused for a very long time. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Maybe Ta-tjenen will
    believe me now, maybe they won't. It's a few questionable shadows versus
    the obvious.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Would you go past Godrhan to get more of a change
    in the shadows? That might convince them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Time Keeper started involuntarily. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But beyond
    Godrhan is the Edge of the World.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer eyed him closely, and under his scrutiny the Time Keeper chuckled,
    perhaps a little nervously.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Does it really matter to Ta-tjenen whether the world
    is flat or round? Ta-tjenen is its own world; it has to be by necessity,
    and no one can blame them for that. Perhaps somebannk it will be different,
    but I doubt it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer laughed at the matter-of-factness of the last statement. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">If it makes you feel any better, you're right.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The silver-haired man shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I knew I was.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Tell me,</q> Stringer said, drenched, back into
    the cabin, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">why do they call you the Time
    Keeper?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Because that's supposed to be my job. It was passed
    on to me over generations. All the previous Time Keepers had the regimen
    worked out fairly well, so all I had to do was learn it. It isn't much of a
    job any more, not unless I can discover a better way of keeping time. And
    you can be sure I haven't been able to do that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But I don't understand why anyone has to do
    it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">How else would you keep track of how long the Bannk
    is?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But can't you do that by looking at the big
    sundial?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And how good is that? Better than most of the
    clocks, actually. But who is to say which Bannk we are on?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I've heard they change.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Most certainly! This is the Weird Bannk, so called
    because, as you have seen, the sun travels almost horizontally across the
    sky, hardly up at all, and even the sunset seems too long—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Not long enough!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It is the shortest of all the Bannks, and the
    temperature is pleasant.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It is?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You saw the sun this Bannk? A trifle. It never finds
    its way into the sky. Wait 'til next Bannk, the Killer Bannk, which is the
    longest of all, and, I'll not tell you wrongly, the sun climbs twice as
    high as in this Bannk. The teclads are long and almost all activity
    stops. But before then is a Short Patra, longer than this Bannk, coming
    shortly, as you can see—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, I can.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">The Killer Bannk is followed by another Short Patra,
    which is in turn followed by another Weird Bannk. After the Weird Bannk we
    have a Long Patra and a Long Bannk, each as long as the other but not as
    long as the Killer Bannk. Following the Long Bannk is a Weird Patra, so
    called because it is as long—or as short—as the Weird Bannk, thus making it
    the shortest of all the Patras. On its heels comes the first of the Short
    Bannks, which is not as long as the Long Bannk but is longer than the Weird
    Bannk—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why do you call it the Short Bannk if it is
    not?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Because the shortest Bannk already has another name:
    the Weird Bannk. If we changed it, then we would have to find another name
    for the Short Bannk. But to continue—the Short Bannk is followed by the
    Deep Freeze, equally as long as the Killer Bannk. The Deep Freeze precedes
    another Short Bannk, as short—or as long—as a Short Patra, which is
    followed consecutively by a Weird Patra, a Long Bannk, a Long Patra, and
    then the cycle starts all over again with the Weird Bannk after seven
    Bannks and seven Patras. So the sundial must keep track of seven Bannks,
    and we have not even discussed what to do in the Patra.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">If there are seven Bannks to keep track of, then
    how come the sundial only shows four scales? I should think there would be
    seven.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">If you were counting, there are only four different
    types of Patras and Bannks, although the cycle is seven Patra-Bannks
    long.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How long is a Patra-Bannk, if they're all
    different?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Either that question is meaningless or the answer is
    obvious. But let's not digress. We are talking about the Time Keeper. Of
    course, my duties don't stop with just deciding which Bannk we are on,
    which the sundial does, anyway. There is the Golun calendar as well, and, I
    ask you, what about the Parlztlu? Of course, there is the additional task
    of keeping track of how long the beclad is at any given time—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How long a beclad is? Do you mean all the units
    change?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No,</q> the Time Keeper replied. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">The clad itself, which goes by in the flap of a
    solofar, is too short to bother changing, as is the belclad. But telclads,
    beclads, and teclads all change noticeably. Telclads only on the best
    clocks. Otherwise—or even in that case—the error usually swamps the actual
    change. So beclads and teclads remain to worry about.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But how can the larger units change and not the
    smaller?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">If you change a large unit—make it larger, for
    instance—then I'd say you can either increase the small units
    proportionally or just put in more of the small units into the large.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What if they don't fit?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you mean, what if there's not an integral
    number?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Right.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">As I've said, the clad is quite small, so there is
    always an integral number in, say, even a telclad.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Not theoretically.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I'm not talking about theory, am I?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That sounds like cheating to me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No, it's just a matter of how accurately we want to
    bother defining the units. I quantize them. That makes it easy, I'll say
    truthfully.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">If that makes it easy, why bother with any of
    this?</q> Stringer asked, throwing up his arms. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">What good can changing the units do?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Well, let's think about it, should we not?
    Obviously, the Bannks and Patras all differ greatly in a highly
    asymmetrical fashion, and it is hard to remember exactly how—as you've just
    seen. Time between Mid-bannk and sunset varies between each Bannk as well
    as from sunrise to Mid-bannk. But what Ta-tjenen is interested in is simply
    when to come Above and when to go Under. So it is just as easy to keep
    everything nice and even, let's say six teclads for each Bannk and each
    Patra. I think that's reasonable.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Okay, then you have to change the size of the unit
    from Bannk to Patra. That seems fairly reasonable, even though on my world
    I've never heard of such a thing. But to change them during the Bannk seems
    absolutely outrageous.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Well, I suppose that depends on how you define a
    teclad, don't you think? We define it as the time it takes the sun to move
    one-third of the way up or down the sky. And of course that changes. You
    see the sun move quickly at first, then slow down as it approaches its
    maximum, and then speed up again on its way back down.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What a ridiculous system! No wonder no one in
    Ta-tjenen ever knows what time it is!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">How would <em>you</em> define a teclad?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why not just a sixth of a given Bannk?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And how do you determine how long <em>that</em> is?
    With bad clocks, it's easier to measure the angle of the sun. But, in
    concession to your views, I was toying with the idea of keeping the teclad
    constant and changing the angle in the sky which the sun moves during its
    traversal. However, that bothered me a little.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I should hope so.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It does seem that the size of an angle should remain
    fixed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why not the size of a beclad or a teclad? Are they
    any less real?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">As I've asked you before, how do you define these
    terms? Not only is it hard to conceive of what a teclad might be, once
    that's decided, but it is hard enough to measure, so you might as well
    change it if we need to. I admit, though, I balked at changing the angle in
    the sky.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm at least glad for that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">At any rate, no matter what system you use, or what
    system I use, building a clock that keeps good time on Patra-Bannk is
    difficult; there is so little to check it with, especially during the
    Patra, when there is nothing to check it with. I do have one of our best
    here.…</q> The silver-haired man opened a cabinet door, and Stringer saw a
    beautiful device that had seven large dials and two smaller ones. The
    calibrations, like those on the sundial at Ta-tjenen, were uneven on the
    seven larger scales. The whole was mounted in brass and inlaid with
    polished gems.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why are there seven scales here and only four for
    the sundial?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">If you remember, there are only four different types
    of Bannks and Patras, as I told you, but the cycle is seven Patra-Bannks
    long. This clock counts them separately.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So why does the sundial have only four?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Why do you see with your eyes? Because a shadow
    can't tell the difference between two Bannks that are the same, that's
    why. My grandfather built this, or my grandmother, I'm not sure which,
    although I'm told that the jewels are from the Polkraitz themselves. We
    have few enough now.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Tell me one more thing: What is the Golun-Patra?
    It keeps following me around and I don't think I like it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">The Golun-Patra occurs once every ninety-seven
    Patra-Bannks.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why is that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Because the Golun is ninety-seven beclads long,
    whereas the Patra-Bannk is one hundred forty-four.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head. How Tjenens always answered the wrong question! <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">But what is a Golun and why is it ninety-seven
    beclads?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The elder man scratched his head. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Well, the Golun is
    one-third of a Parlztlu, why I can't say exactly. But if you start off the
    Golun and Patra-Bannk together, they don't coincide again for another
    ninety-seven Patra-Bannks, one Golun-Patra. This is the twelfth Golun-Patra
    since the revolt, a special anniversary because it is the twelfth.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And does it have something to do with the return
    of the Polkraitz?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I don't know. Does it have anything to do with
    that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer stood up angrily. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Sarek or
    Verlaxchi—whichever is in charge around here! That old woman Kenken Wer,
    who tried to kill me, and most of Ta-tjenen seem to think it does.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Kenken Wer, yes. The Great Cackler. Well, I can't
    speak for her.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer gritted his teeth and threw up his arms once more. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I think I need some more fresh air.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer went above and stood in the rain. It was, even now, heavier than
    when he was last on deck. The boat was approaching a part of the coast
    where the great fire had done its work, and the damage was clear to
    see. The forest, not dense to begin with, was scattered with burned-out
    stumps and charred fern-moss. It wasn't a pleasant sight, but one that went
    well with this planet.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Time Keeper then noticed the forest. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Verlaxchi!
    What happened?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">There was a great fire just before the rains. Most
    of the forest is in ruins. You will not be returning to a happy city, Time
    Keeper.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you know if there is fuel enough?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">For this Patra, at least, I was told. If I were
    Ta-tjenen, I would start being like most worlds and begin using oil.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Oil? Certainly there isn't enough oil in all the
    grask in Ta-tjenen to do that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, I mean oil from the ground.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I've never heard of any of that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Curious maybe, maybe not. But then there seem to
    be a few curious things about this planet. The gravity, for instance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Humph. I never could understand it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Neither could I, but something is certainly wrong
    on Patra-Bannk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The old man's eyes lit up. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Really? The world is
    always much more interesting when something is wrong with it. Tell me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Let me get it straight. I think I finally
    remembered the exact expression. The weight of an object on a planet is
    proportional to the mass of the planet divided by the radius squared—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Amazing! Is it always true? Everywhere?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, as far as I know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Incredible! Go on! Go on! Aha…</q> The little man
    went dancing around the deck in the rain, falling several times as the boat
    pitched.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Now, see if I make sense. On my planet, which is
    about one-fiftieth the diameter of this one, I weigh about the same as I do
    here—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I see! That means the mass of Patra-Bannk is about
    twenty-five hundred times that of your world.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was glad to be talking to someone who understood him. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">But don't you see how ridiculous that is? The volume
    of Patra-Bannk is one hundred twenty thousand times that of my world, so
    the mass can't be twenty-five hundred times that of my world unless the
    density is fifty times less than on—</q> Two-Bit didn't translate. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">If the density was the same or even nearly, I should
    weigh about fifty times more than I do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Amazing.</q> The older man turned to the captain of
    the boat. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Put us ashore a minute, would you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="boat captain">In this weather? Are you sure?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes, yes, go ahead. Don't mind the waves. Go
    ahead.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    After having some trouble in the rugged surf, the boat was beached and the
    Time Keeper hopped to the ground with a box of odds and ends he had taken
    from the cabin. Within a few beclads he had constructed a crude but
    admirably serviceable balance and began measuring out equal volumes of
    sand, rock, and water. He put a bit of dirt on the balance, then emptied
    the dish and filled it with water, placing that on the balance instead. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Is your world made out of dirt?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">A lot of it is. I don't know how much. A lot is
    water, too.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Well, Stringer Who Asks Odd Questions, if that is
    true, then I would guess that Patra-Bannk would float on water—if you found
    an ocean big enough.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">If! But that's what I thought,</q> said Stringer
    as he climbed back aboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Are you sure your gravity is right?</q> asked the
    other as he gathered up his toys.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Absolutely. Everybody learns it when they're
    ten. I forgot about it until I got here; I never had any use for it. But
    I'm sure that's the formula.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Surely you misremembered. The observations show you
    are wrong: you are standing on your own two feet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, I am sure I am right.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I am certain you are wrong. How does one figure it
    out? I'd like to check it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That I don't know—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But that is what is important to know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you mean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It seems to me that it is more important to know how
    to verify what you say than to know the fact itself, don't you think,
    especially since you're so obviously mistaken?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm not sure. All I can tell you is that it has
    something to do with measuring the positions of the planets against the
    stars in the night sky—</q> Something suddenly struck Stringer. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Of course you wouldn't know; you're always
    underground at night.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But I have seen stars. Once in a great while, if my
    clock is off enough so that I go out to find the sunrise much too early, by
    a few beclads, I can see one or two. I'm not sure what they are, perhaps
    balls of ice, parts of the atmosphere frozen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer smiled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Not balls of ice, and I don't
    think one or two would be good enough. Somehow you have to observe the
    planets and figure out how they go around the sun—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What do you mean, go around the sun?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That's what I mean.</q> Stringer then remembered
    his discussions with Taljen. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Don't you believe
    that Patra-Bannk goes around the sun?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No, should I?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you mean to tell me, Time Keeper with the Bad
    Clocks, that you have decided the world is round and yet you still believe
    the sun and the stars—all two of them—move around Patra-Bannk?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I don't see what one thing has to do with the
    other. Anyone with eyes in his head can see that the sun goes around
    Patra-Bannk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer laughed aloud, but it was at himself. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">You're right. Absolutely. Well, I wish you luck, Time
    Keeper Who Asks the Right Questions. I can tell you it took some of the
    greatest minds in history to figure out gravity, and I certainly am not one
    of them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Who is?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer laughed again and was happy.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Ten</div>Conjectures and
  Refutations</h2>

  <p>
    Pike and Paddelack searched every nook and cranny of the metallic hydrogen
    storeroom until they were convinced that it was plainly a storeroom and
    nothing else. During the investigation, which Pike guessed took more than a
    day because the room was so huge, Paddelack had found a large cubical
    structure with one face open in which some of the plates were stacked. They
    hoped they might have found an opening underneath that led to a transport
    facility, but finally became convinced that either there was no such
    facility or the opening to it had been tightly sealed off.
  </p>

  <p>
    They gradually widened the search area to places on either side but found
    nothing that they could positively connect with the metallic hydrogen
    supply. Adjoining rooms—the few that were open—evidently contained controls
    of some sort, but just as the layman who enters a giant laboratory can make
    neither head nor tail of the blinking lights, so these control rooms were
    equally unintelligible to Pike and Paddelack. A week's time passed and then
    another, and the discouragement began to settle in once more.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">We were so close,</q> Pike sighed, sitting down on a
    stack of the plates. <q ab:speaker="Pike">And yet the answer has eluded
    us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Remember what you've got, though,</q> Paddelack
    said. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Also remember that we don't have any idea
    where the factory might be. We're assuming it is in or near this city. It
    might not even be on this planet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike rolled his eyes. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Don't say that. Searching this
    city is proving impossible enough, walking forever down vacant streets and
    alleys. Can you imagine searching the entire planet? Or the Universe? I
    don't even want to think about it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Do you think answers are easy to find? You're the
    one who's always talking about patience.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike left Paddelack and walked to a nearby building to continue the search
    there. Within an hour, or what Paddelack would have called about two
    telclads, Pike had found a staircase near the main entrance of the new
    building. He looked down at the wide treads and decided they were
    negotiable. Then he went to get Paddelack.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well?</q> he asked, questioning Paddelack with his
    eyes as they both looked down.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">If you have a gateway—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Let's go.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They descended the spiral on uncomfortably large treads for a very long
    time. They tried counting the number of steps but eventually lost
    track. Pike tried to guess the size of the builders by the depth of the
    treads, but he realized that if he had done that with stairs on Two-Bit, he
    would have ranged those builders from midgets to giants, with all sizes in
    between.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I hope we manage to find a better way up, or I
    don't think I will make it,</q> groaned Paddelack.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually the staircase ended. Paddelack craned his neck, looking back up
    the way they had come. There was no way to tell if they had descended five
    hundred meters or a thousand or even more; the far end of the staircase
    converged to a blur.
  </p>

  <p>
    They walked through a short corridor that joined a larger causeway. Several
    grooved tracks ran down the center of the floor. Paddelack knelt and ran
    his finger over the nearest one. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I think this is
    more metallic hydrogen. Frictionless rails, maybe? Do you think the
    builders would stoop to anything so simple?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack did not notice the gap until he rose to his feet. His eyes
    followed the nearby wall to waist height and then up to nothing at all. He
    rushed over to the causeway's edge and tried to put his hand over the top
    of the wall. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Ouch,</q> he grumbled as his hand
    met something invisible and unyielding. The material was very transparent,
    more transparent than glass, almost invisible.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">It might be quartz,</q> Pike said, trying to scratch
    it with his knife.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack was not listening but stood with his bird-beaked nose pressed
    hard against the surface for many moments. He could barely see something
    above him, perhaps the ceiling. It extended in all directions for the
    little distance he could see in the causeway light. From the other side of
    the causeway he sensed some vague shapes and the ceiling above him extended
    outward again.
  </p>

  <p>
    He left the window, pulling on his nose, and then slowly faced Pike with
    glazed eyes. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">God, it is. Just as we guessed. For
    twenty years I wondered, and it's true. This planet is a hollow shell and
    we're on the inside.</q> He pointed upward. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">That's the inner surface right above our heads.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head in disbelief. After a long
    pause he said, <q ab:speaker="Pike">That certainly would explain the low
    density.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I hope that doesn't make the planet too
    light. That shell would have to be mighty heavy to produce the gravity we
    see.</q> Then Paddelack snapped his fingers and clicked his tongue. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">No, I'm wrong. Sorry.</q> He sighed in relief. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">We're not on the inside of a hollow sphere.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">It sounded like a good idea—I guess. What's wrong with
    it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">We'd be weightless, neglecting, of course, the
    small gravity produced by this causeway beneath us.</q> Paddelack could see
    by the shake of Pike's head that he didn't understand. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">If you are on the inside of a sphere, inside the
    hollow, gravity cancels out and you're left weightless. And that's true
    anywhere on the inside.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">How can gravity cancel out?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Let's see if I remember how it works: if we are
    close to one section of the wall, that section pulls us toward it with a
    much greater force than the far section of the wall pulls us in the
    opposite direction.</q> Pike nodded. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">But in a
    sphere, the far section is then much bigger than the near section, so it
    attracts you more because it is bigger and has more mass to it. The two
    effects cancel out on the inside of a sphere, and we're left
    weightless.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">But clearly we're not,</q> Pike concluded, taking his
    sigh of relief.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Clearly. That's one theory shot, by
    Sarek—Verlaxchi, for that matter.</q> Paddelack turned again to the
    blackness. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">But I do want to go out there.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">All right, but first let's see what else is here. I
    don't want to make too many trips up that stairway.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The two men continued down the causeway, walking slowly as if they were
    afraid someone would jump out at them. They hadn't gone far before Pike
    spied an object lying outside the window. He quickened his pace until it
    was almost a run, and then he abruptly stopped. On his right, connected to
    the causeway by a passage, was a ship. It wasn't like any ship Pike had
    ever seen, but there were enough similarities to his previous experiences
    to convince him it was a ship. It had no wings and wasn't streamlined, but
    it had openings for engines and windows to see through. It was a ship. Then
    the Gostum claim of rockets at Triesk rang in his head.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another ship could be seen beyond the first, and more beyond. Pike followed
    along the line, first slowly and then faster, until he was running. Each
    was different, all very different. They were small. They might be shuttles,
    but to where? Suddenly Pike realized that Paddelack was no longer with
    him. He stopped and turned around. Paddelack was a hundred meters behind,
    motionless, peering out into the gloom.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike ran back and joined his companion. Paddelack was shaking his head
    confusedly. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Is it?</q> he asked hurriedly, still
    out of breath from the run. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Please tell me
    no.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike joined him at the observation window and clenched his jaw. His reply
    was at first hesitant. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'm not sure. It does
    look…similar.</q> After a long pause he spoke again, sounding overly
    convinced. <q ab:speaker="Pike">No, it is only similar. Not the same, I
    tell you.</q> His response was so firmly negative because it was the only
    answer that admitted sanity. He pressed his face closer to the pane, which
    only became visible under his breath. The ship sitting in the spindly
    berth, only dimly lit by the causeway light, was distressingly similar to
    their own shuttlecraft.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I want to go inside,</q> Paddelack announced
    suddenly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And, I ask you, how?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What about this?</q> Paddelack replied as he
    traced his finger around what was clearly a door in the causeway that led
    to a gangplank on the other side. His hand stopped at what appeared to be a
    latch set into the surface.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No, don't,</q> Pike said, grasping Paddelack's
    hand. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Let's get some suits first. We don't know what,
    if anything, is inside.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Of course. Give me some credit, will you? Now
    let's find our way back up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    As they walked back down the concourse, Paddelack noticed, in some small
    part of his mind, that the gangway doors were of different sizes and the
    latches varied widely in construction, but the thought never verbalized
    itself, and he soon forgot about it altogether.
  </p>

  <p>
    They got back to the stairwell and Pike was about to start up
    again. However, after a few moments' search they discovered an elevator
    near the stairs. When the door opened, both men jumped back in fright.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike"><em>Sarek!</em></q> Pike shouted. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">If you abandoned a city, would you leave it in working
    order for any vagabond who happened to stumble by?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Do you include yourself in that category?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Of course not.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Then remember about webbed feet and eagles and
    let's go.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    When they reached <em>Number Two</em>, Barbalan was not there. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Where do you think she is?</q> Paddelack asked as he
    checked the rear compartments.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">It's a big planet. Maybe she went for a walk. She'll
    turn up.</q> Pike took two suits out of storage and handed one to
    Paddelack. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I doubt that she has gone far. It's clear
    that there is no place to go, right?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack hesitantly took one of the suits, and then returned to the city
    and descended into the interior of the planet.
  </p>

  <p>
    The latch on the door responded easily to Paddelack's twist. When he looked
    at the gauge on his chest, it became apparent that the only thing in the
    gangway was air. Stale air at that, Paddelack decided while taking off his
    helmet and sniffing around him. The shuttle hatch opened just as easily and
    a cabin light went on. Both men sighed audibly. The console was arranged
    differently, the displays were of an unfamiliar design, although the
    overall arrangement was similar to that of <em>Number Two</em>. But it was
    not a replica—not quite.
  </p>

  <p>
    They looked around for a few moments until Pike found a hatch that surely
    led outside. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well?</q> he said with an added cock of
    an eyebrow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack answered by putting on his helmet. Pike followed suit and they
    opened the door. They were in an air lock. They opened the outer door and
    the air whooshed out around them. Paddelack watched the needle of the
    vacuum gauge on his chest swing as close to zero as it could get and stay
    there pinned. Somehow, although he was not sure why, he had expected this.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">It's high vacuum out there,</q> he remarked. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">This gauge goes down to about ten-to-the-minus-seven
    millimeters, and I'll bet it's lower out there. I wonder how much
    lower.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I wouldn't know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack raised the lantern he had brought with him and saw that
    all-embracing ceiling and the supports for the rocket berths. He pointed
    the lamp downward and saw nothing. But it was downward. If they had been in
    a hollow sphere, there would not have been any preferred direction, no up,
    down, or sideways. Yet here was an up and a down. Down was at his feet; up
    was at his head. Paddelack was stymied.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">So,</q> said Pike, interrupting his thoughts, <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">where does that get us?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Absolutely nowhere.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They returned to the surface in silence and headed back to <em>Number
    Two</em>. Barbalan was missing still, but both men knew she could take care
    of herself and decided not to search immediately, not having any idea of
    where to look. Paddelack sat down at the ship's computer and after a few
    minutes shook his head. Pike peered over his shoulder at the sketches he
    had drawn.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack laughed. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I thought that if this planet
    was made out of metallic hydrogen, I'd figure out the thickness of a shell
    needed to produce the observed gravity. I don't know the density of
    metallic hydrogen, so I took a guess at magnesium and used that instead. I
    thought that would give me a ballpark estimate—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And—?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">If we are willing to believe that this planet is
    a shell of the order of ten thousand kilometers thick, then it might
    work. I don't believe it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And how does that explain the vacuum a kilometer
    down?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">It doesn't, of course, unless the rocket hangar
    is some kind of pocket in the shell. That theory sounds almost
    plausible. But the theorizing gets fancier with every additional assumption
    and less tasty, too. Planet's not a shell of metallic hydrogen, I'll say
    that with Bitter Certainty.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You will? Give yourself credit, Paddy. If what you
    tell me about gravity canceling out inside spheres is true, then it seems
    to me we really have no evidence that we went beneath the shell at all. In
    fact, my good Paddelack, we may have barely scratched the surface, so we'd
    still feel gravity. Thus, it seems to me that your original thick-shell
    hypothesis is a good one—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Except for the vacuum.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Easier to explain than gravity, wouldn't you say?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You can have it your way. I refuse to believe
    that anyone could build a shell of metallic hydrogen ten thousand
    kilometers thick. I'm absolutely positive. I'd rather believe Patra-Bannk
    is natural. Theorists these days are so slippery they can figure out a way
    for anything to happen. The rule to follow is: if it is not expressly
    forbidden, then it's compulsory. A rather totalitarian way of looking at
    things, but it always works; half the major discoveries of the last three
    hundred years were predicted by the use of that principle.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well,</q> Pike concluded with a sigh as he picked up
    the crumpled ball of paper and tossed it in his hands, <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">we have more important things to occupy us, like a
    manufacturing facility to find.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">And a missing girl. Which do we attend to
    first?</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The search for both Barbalan and the manufacturing facility went on for
    more weeks. Paddelack had no idea of where to look for the girl. If she was
    outside the city, finding a needle in a haystack would have been easy work
    compared with the odds of locating her. If she had managed to get in,
    despite the Fear, the odds were several orders of magnitude better, but
    still infinitesimal. And did she have food? If not, she would surely be
    dead already. Paddelack grew despondent, and his frame of mind began to
    infect Pike.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What do you want me to do?</q> Pike cried. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">All we can hope to do is run into her somewhere along the
    line.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack trudged up the ramp. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Why don't we
    forget the facility and try to find her? Even if we locate what we are
    looking for, chances are we won't even know it. All we've seen are
    buildings enclosed in this giant tent, empty rooms, amphitheaters,
    who-knows-what-else built by who-knows-what. About all we can tell is
    nothing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike let him run on. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Do you want to leave? What chance
    of finding her then?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack sighed and kept walking up the ramp. Pike followed, and as the
    ramp emptied onto a large circular area, he scratched the back of his
    neck. Why they hadn't come this way before, he couldn't understand. After
    all, it was a perfectly obvious place to come. The room was centrally
    placed, right beneath the translucent dome that capped the city at its
    center. You would have thought it would be the first place to look. But
    though they hadn't come before, they were here now. As always, the lights
    were on when they entered. Pike could never quite catch them going on or
    off, but he felt that was what they were doing. It made him feel
    uncomfortable, as if he were being watched.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike noticed that several other ramps from different directions emptied
    onto the platform as well. The room was big, and the translucent dome above
    made it look even bigger. In the center stood a cylinder that itself must
    have been ten meters across. Thick shiny posts around the circumference
    supported the cylinder, so that you could walk under and inside
    it. Paddelack did so and Pike followed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The inner surface lit up immediately to reveal a huge, three hundred
    sixty-degree map of a planet. The top of the map was high above their
    heads but cleverly constructed so that the upper latitudes were not
    distorted and could be seen as clearly as the lower parts.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Patra-Bannk?</q> asked Pike.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Of course, it must be.</q> But Paddelack's <q>of
    course</q> took a few minutes to manifest itself as they searched for
    something familiar. They failed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And what about those lines?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The lines. They were, indeed, curious. A network of hair-thin lines
    crisscrossed the map, each line terminating at a clearly marked
    point. Thousands of such lines, perhaps even tens of thousands, spanned the
    huge world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, Paddelack found Konndjlan, or rather the Massarat range, almost
    unnoticed on a small continent—a continent that might have been ten times
    the size of all of Two-Bit. His eyes passed across the ocean to rest on
    what must have been Daryephna. A few dozen lines radiated from its point on
    the map. Most of those lines traveled either east or southwest across the
    ocean to link up with other dots.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Look at that spot up there!</q> Paddelack
    pointed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I've noticed that,</q> Pike replied. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">There must be five dozen lines from that one. Hmm, that
    one ends up where you say Massarat should be.</q> Pike pointed to the
    magnified spot high above his head.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Ah.</q> Paddelack scowled. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">It could be anywhere. Scale is too big. Do you think
    it could be a communications network of some kind?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Between what?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You do have a point there. Where do you suppose
    that major intersection is?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The question was asked innocently, almost rhetorically, but something
    clicked for Pike. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Of course! It's Triesk! I'm sure of
    it. It's just where Triesk is on the Polkraitz map. It must be.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">But the scale,</q> Paddelack shot back, shaking
    his head. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I'm telling you, you could be off by a
    thousand kilometers at least.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No. Look at the distance between Massarat and that
    point. It's perceivable, about thirty centimeters, would you say? If
    Massarat and Triesk are a hundred thousand kilometers apart, that must be
    it. Besides, look at the curve on the coast, the latitude compared with
    Daryephna, the mountain range ending somewhat south of it. We can check the
    other map, but I'm sure.…Could the Gostum have had something?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What do you mean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Have the people of Triesk found something that might
    explain all this? We found rockets here; there might also be rockets at
    Triesk. We have to go and find out. Do we have all the hydrogen loaded
    aboard the <em>Crimson</em> that we can carry?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Yes, I think so.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Good, let's go to Triesk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What about Barbalan?</q> Paddelack added, his
    small eyes flitting from the map to his feet. Part of his mind thought that
    Pike's mental equations between Daryephna and Triesk, Gostum and rockets,
    were total lunacy, the same type of brilliant gyrations that allowed him to
    equate <q>almost-plausibles</q> in other people's actions with certainties
    and were responsible for his frequent, sometimes hysterical, accusations
    about their behavior. But part of his mind knew that Pike and his ability
    to equate unrelateds might achieve something, and he could feel the
    excitement rising. And part of him felt responsible for the safety of
    others.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sound of feet being dragged across the floor resolved the dilemma.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike and Paddelack">Barbalan!</q> both men shouted as
    one. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">How did you get in here?</q> Paddelack ran
    over to give her support, but she was not about to fall over.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Where have you been?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Did you have food?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan looked only slightly more slender than her usual slender self. She
    opened her mouth and was about to speak when she took notice of the map
    surrounding her. Her hand found it way into her sporran and she fingered the
    Fairtalian necklace. Then she shook her head to clear it and suddenly
    sprang to life.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">You must come with me,</q> she urged, pulling
    Paddelack by the arm. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">It is important; you must
    come!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack glanced toward Pike helplessly and let himself be dragged. The
    three of them ran down the ramp to the main level and then down
    another. Following a long, confusing route, Barbalan led them into a
    low-lying building that was overshadowed by the overhang of
    another. Inside, Paddelack barely had time to examine his surroundings when
    Barbalan tried to force him into a kind of chair. He resisted, grabbing
    her arm.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What is the problem?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Please, it is important.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What are you doing? What is going to happen
    here?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike interrupted. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'll sit down. Nothing has happened
    to us yet; why should anything happen to us now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike sat down on the chair, which seemed to mold itself to his
    body. Suddenly he stiffened, shouted, and put his hands tightly to his
    temples. In a moment he had fallen to the floor and Paddelack had pulled
    him up. The Fear? Had it finally materialized in this room? Paddelack
    didn't wait to find out but dragged his companion from the room and the
    building and into the street. He looked at Barbalan suspiciously.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">But…but you must understand. I don't…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack ignored her, and when Pike had recovered sufficiently, the two
    hurried out of the city. Barbalan ran after them, pleading with them to
    return. Neither Pike nor Paddelack would turn back now. As they exited
    Daryephna, Paddelack could feel the relatively cool air whistle around
    them. The sun was very low, flat gray clouds streaked the sky. It was
    raining over the city and snow was on its way. It would not be long now.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Pike looked well enough to speak, Paddelack questioned him. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">What happened?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I don't know. It was like a sledgehammer,
    though. <em>Wham</em>, and I was out.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Are you all right now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I think so. But I also think that it is high time to
    go to Triesk before we get into any more trouble with the city's
    defenses.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack nodded, then took another look at the sun. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Oh no, I just remembered something. We're too
    late.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What do you mean, my good friend? Explain
    yourself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">It was stupid to forget, but it is also
    understandable. I guess we forgot because we've been here for so long
    now. On Two-Bit you fly across the ocean and the time changes several
    hours. We flew across the ocean and time changed back more than half a
    teclad. I'd guess we're about twenty Two-Bit days behind Triesk. Over
    there, the Patra has already begun, as it will here shortly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What a stupid mistake! We waited too long.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">We can't stay here too much longer, either, even
    if we wanted to. We're running out of food. I suppose we could head back to
    the big ship.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike screwed up his lips and thought. <q ab:speaker="Pike">We have to
    refuel at the <em>Crimson</em>, anyway, sooner or later. But I suggest that
    for the Patra we go to Konndjlan.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack"><em>What!</em></q> Paddelack shrieked. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Are you gone completely?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No, listen. We don't know what is going to happen to
    us if we stay here, on several counts. We may freeze to death, or whatever
    it was that got me may decide to get us again. We have failed to find the
    manufacturing facility, besides, and the next step is, obviously, to go to
    Triesk. But we can't go now, because I gather they are already Under for
    the Patra, or Going Under. So we have to wait for the Bannk. The Gostum
    wanted us, so let them have us, and we can be comfortable.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack just stared, wide-eyed, then threw his spindly arms into the air
    and walked away.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike climbed into the shuttle. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Barbalan,</q> he said,
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">we're going to Konndjlan.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    She didn't understand him, of course.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Eleven</div>Homecoming</h2>

  <p>
    The water was getting rougher under the tutelage of the winds. It splashed
    up over bow and stern as the crewmen tied the small craft to the
    dock. Stringer strapped on his kalan and holstered his graser across his
    chest.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And why is this?</q> the Time Keeper asked as he came
    out of the cabin with a bundle of paper hidden beneath his oiled jacket.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That's a long story,</q> Stringer replied, his
    sack slung over the bow.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Where are you going, Hurried Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">To my ship.</q> Stringer paused on the dock
    briefly. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Tell me, are you called anything else
    besides Time Keeper?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Of course,</q> the Time Keeper chuckled. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">My name is Alhane.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Good. I'll see you again.</q> Stringer hurried off
    with the rain lashing his face, over the rise and up the once sandy
    road. It was a few kilometers to the city, which he avoided, skirting
    around the acropolis and heading past the fields. He soon entered the
    nearest part of the forest, which was still intact. The trees were almost
    fully closed, and Stringer could smell the resin that was binding the trunks
    together. They bent this way and that in the stiff wind, and Stringer
    covered his eyes with his hands to protect his face.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally he reached <em>Number One</em>. As he expected, it lay there
    untouched. He doubted that any Tjenen would think of touching it, much less
    molesting it. The forward hatch opened to his usual heavy tug and he
    climbed in. Ash, having found its way through the shattered window, covered
    both console and floor, and the rain water had mixed with it, forming an
    ugly slime. Stringer opened one of the storage bins behind the cockpit and
    fetched a sheet of malleable plastic insulation. After a few moments he had
    managed to fix it tightly over the window. Then he pressed for fuel
    readings. He checked the storage bins for food rations. He went to the
    computer console and punched in a few numbers. The answers returned
    instantaneously. The numbers on the screen reflected off his eyes, and he
    bit his lip and tapped his fingers on the console. The answer was no answer
    at all. He had enough food, or could certainly muster anything else he
    needed. The remaining fuel might be enough to heat the shuttle for the
    Patra, the long Short Patra. But then again, it might not. Stringer pursed
    his lips and nodded. Well, he would find out soon enough.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Alhane stumbled past a yard littered with his collection of instruments and
    tripped into a house equally littered. He was tired after the long
    expedition and wanted only to sleep. He dumped his armload of papers onto
    the first chair beyond the door and began to remove his cloak.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Alhane! I was hoping you would be in about now.</q>
    The voice from the workroom was a familiar one, and he walked into his shop
    to see his former pupil, present assistant, Taljen. She ran up to him and
    encircled his small body with her own. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It is good to
    see you again. It has been a long Bannk without you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And equally long without you, my young helper. Tell
    me, are my children about?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No, they are off trying to build something to
    impress you, no doubt. A strange thing to have children. And tell me, my
    Favorite Fool Alhane, have you discovered your empty theory yet?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane smiled. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No, I am sure that one glance at your
    data will tell me that I was right. Let me see your Mid-bannk readings.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen showed him the papers she had kept. Alhane looked for the shortest
    length of any shadow that Taljen had recorded, as well as those she had
    collected and averaged from the other helpers. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Aha!
    You see, I was right. There is absolutely no question any longer. Five
    centimeters' difference at least between my shortest and all of yours. Look
    at this.</q> Alhane ran into the other room and brought in his own data.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen ran her eyes over it, nodded slowly, and sat down on a chair.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Why, you don't seem to be very happy about it. This
    is a great occasion, is it not?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You could still be wrong. It is only a handful of
    centimeters. A mistake would be all too probable. To change, the shape of
    the world on a handful of centimeters…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But the trend! The difference is bigger than it was
    at Glintz. Look here! The trend! It's what you'd expect if you travel
    further, isn't it? And the times and all the other objections? We've gone
    over that before.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I…I guess you're right,</q> Taljen said. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Oh, I don't know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Why, then, are you so unhappy? It doesn't matter
    that I was right or that you were wrong, but that we have found out
    something about the world that we didn't know before. Isn't that enough?
    Why bring ideology into it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It's not that at all. It's that…that maybe I have
    made a mistake; I'm not sure.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">There is certainly nothing wrong with making
    mistakes, as long as we make them as fast as possible.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It has nothing to do with the experiment, Teacher,
    but with the Alien. I thought he was just a murderer who talked with ideas
    crazier than your own, who asked stupid questions that were impossible to
    answer and got everyone he met angry at him.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I have met an Alien on my trip, and his questions
    were most interesting.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What?</q> Taljen looked up abruptly and grabbed
    Alhane's arm. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Tell me his name! Do you know it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes, of course. His name is Stringer and he is
    somewhere about now. I brought him back when we found him stranded down the
    coast.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen froze. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Lashgar help us! He's back. Benjfold…I
    must warn him. Who knows what will happen—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What are you talking about?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen had already jumped out of the chair. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer
    killed Mornli, my first brother's nesta's sister, when he came to Ta-tjenen
    and was going to be exposed. He tried to escape during the fire and
    Benjfold tried to kill him by throwing him overboard. There is no time; I
    must warn Benjfold.</q> Taljen started to run out of the room, but
    Alhane caught her.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Stringer didn't seem like a murderer to me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I don't know what Stringer is, but he isn't one of
    us, that's all I can tell you. Now let me go.</q> She bolted out the door
    and Alhane shuffled after her.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Stringer was crossing the plaza, shining wet in the rain. The gnomon's
    shadow was gone, wiped out by the black clouds, and he doubted that any
    Tjenen was aware of the time. Work would continue as long as possible,
    which wasn't long now. Lightning streaked across the sky and thunder rolled
    over his head. The wind whipped at the battered old cloak that he had
    always worn on Two-Bit, and he had to walk hunched over, holding the guy
    ropes so as not to be blown over by the wind. His kalan felt good thumping
    against his thigh. It was anxious to be used. The gong of the town bell,
    its restraining rope broken, clanged in the howling wind against Stringer's
    ear.
  </p>

  <p>
    People were slinging nets over their houses and tying the ends to stakes
    that were everywhere driven into the ground. Now he understood their
    function: the real winds were on their way.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Clang!</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    He pulled his hood more tightly around his face and kept walking in long,
    hunched strides. Uslid's house was not far.
  </p>

  <p>
    He passed the main gateway. Supplies were being taken Under for the Patra,
    the long Short Patra. Huge carts, loaded with household good, food, and now
    the precious wood for fuel, disappeared into the mouths of the
    gateways. The wind was biting and the cool rain heavy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Uslid's house was third after <q>Chicken Market.</q> The Tjenens named
    intersections or places, not streets. A stupid convention, thought
    Stringer; it made giving directions impossible. But everyone in Ta-tjenen
    seemed to know everyone else and where they lived. And even he knew where
    he was going.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Clang! Clang!</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    It was late Bannk and, of necessity, the doors to the houses were shut. The
    house of Uslid was crisscrossed with rope and staked down. Stringer could
    not tell if anyone was inside. There was as good a chance that they would be
    asleep as not; everyone went by his own cycle. Stringer drew his kalan.
  </p>

  <p>
    The door opened easily; Tjenens' doors were never locked. Stringer took
    three steps before Benjfold looked up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer undid his hood and pushed it back from his head. Benjfold gasped
    and fell backward off his stool, flattening himself against the creaking
    wall.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Give me one good reason why I shouldn't pierce
    your throat,</q> Stringer said, swinging the knife point under the other's
    chin.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">You wouldn't risk killing me, not after the
    first—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why not? Ta-tjenen and I are nearing the parting
    of the ways, anyway, Benjfold Traitor. I was to leave you in good faith
    before and you tricked me. Why shouldn't I leave you permanently now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">You are Polkraitz; this is the Golun-Patra. You
    caused the fire, you and the Gostum.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">If you believe that, you are more of a fool than I
    thought.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">You would not leave Ta-tjenen alive if you killed
    me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So what else is new?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Benjfold screwed up his face into a contorted knot of fear, and Stringer
    nodded his usual slow nod. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You begin to understand
    what it is like to be under a death sentence. How desperate are you? What
    will you do to live? What kind of bargain will you strike?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">I…I don't know. I don't understand,</q> Benjfold
    managed to cough out. A crack of thunder obscured his last words.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Of course you don't. Everyone you've ever known is
    a close friend. You've never been threatened by anything but Patra-Bannk
    in your life.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen broke in at that instant, with Alhane puffing behind her. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer!</q> she screamed, her voice the highest
    pitch. She dove at him, knocking his arm away. The point of the kalan
    grazed Benjfold's throat and a thin line of blood trickled out. Stringer
    spun around and was gone in a lightning-streaked gray sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    Benjfold got up with his hand clasped around his neck and walked to the
    door. He started out for many moments before Taljen turned him around.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">He almost killed you!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">I'm not sure,</q> replied Benjfold. <q
    ab:speaker="Benjfold">I'm not sure at all.</q> Then he went to bandage his
    wound.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">So,</q> said Alhane, turning to Taljen. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Don't you think Stringer had good reason to want to
    kill Benjfold? Benjfold had tried to kill Stringer before, is that not
    right?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes, but what difference does that make? Stringer
    just wanted—</q> Revenge was a word that Taljen didn't have in her
    vocabulary. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It would be as if I were to kill you or
    my third nesta, or my mother's third cousin.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And what about Benjfold wanting to kill Stringer?
    Whoever heard of that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer has caused many problems.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But, I ask you, is it worth abandoning him to the
    Patra for those problems?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">If he is a killer—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And Benjfold? A killer? Who would believe it? There
    is too much in Stringer to be wasted, my young friend, and I think you see
    that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen nodded with tears in her eyes. She had not cried in many
    Patra-Bannks. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Alhane, you are better at confusing
    things than anyone I have ever met—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Except Stringer. What will you do to help him
    live?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen tossed her hair, heavy and wet. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What can be
    done now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">There may be one thing. The nestrexa is at the heart
    of Ta-tjenen, am I not right?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes, but for yourself, that binds us all
    together. It is true.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">The Parlztluzan is later this beclad, Taljen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen stared at Alhane wide-eyed in shock, but he was already at the
    door. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Tell me, where is Stringer's ship?</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Later, after a long, well-deserved sleep, Alhane stepped into the clearing
    and saw Stringer's shuttle. He admired it for a moment before searching out
    the entrance. When he found it, he pulled the latch open without
    knocking. Knocking wouldn't have occurred to him. But he did hesitate, not
    out of politeness or concern, but because of the slow, mournful music
    emerging from the craft and mixing with the whistling wind and pounding
    rain, struggling to be heard over the frequent thunder. The playing was not
    badly in tune, he thought, but could certainly be better, especially with
    the seventh harmonic off so consistently.
  </p>

  <p>
    He was surprised to see Stringer sitting on the floor, playing a rodoft,
    bowing a melody slowing and deliberately. Stringer ignored him. Alhane took
    this opportunity to look around the craft. He walked forward a step or two
    into the cockpit and back into the cargo hold. He saw a great deal of empty
    space back there, and the hollow amplified the sound of raindrops falling
    on the roof.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you want?</q> came Stringer's voice from
    behind him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I've been told that you plan on staying here for the
    Patra.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I've told no one that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">We guess well. Do you realize how foolish that is?
    How impossible?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">This ship is made for worse conditions than are
    found on your planet—if you can believe it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But you'd be alone, and it will be a Short Patra,
    longer than this Bannk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I have a rodoft and my mind.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Perhaps, Young Stringer, your mind will be your
    worst enemy. And if you survive, what will you do then, I ask you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer continued to bow absently on the rodoft and pluck its strings. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I came with companions who are now lost. I must find
    them if they are to be found. So I will go south.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane sat down. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I didn't know there were
    others. How far are they?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">When I left them, about one hundred thousand
    kilometers, a little more.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Time Keeper shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Humph. A long way,
    to be sure. A hundred thousand! No one at Ta-tjenen thinks in terms of ten
    kilometers, let alone a hundred thousand. If not for my calculations, I
    thank them, I wouldn't have believed the world was that big myself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I know. I've gone through that before, but this
    ship travels that kind of distance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But I see it is damaged. Will you still fly?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No. I'll sail, walk, I don't know. Do you think I
    will stay here?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane shook his head. His silver hair was bright in the cabin light, and
    he had to talk loudly to penetrate the noise of the rain. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">And what will you do next Patra, another Short one, and
    the Patra after that, which is Long, and during the Bannks in between?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you suggest?</q> Stringer sighed, finally
    putting down the bow and looking up for the first time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">First you have to live through the Patra—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I plan on doing my best.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">—and then at the beginning of the Bannk you could
    make a balloon.…No, that wouldn't work; it's too slow and unreliable.…At
    the beginning of the Bannk…Wait! That's it! It might work. It's possible. I
    may be correct—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">A moment, I ask you, wait a moment.…</q> Alhane put
    his hand to his chin. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes, why not? At the beginning
    of the Bannk and almost all through the Bannk, the ocean is cooler than the
    land; I've measured it myself, I'll not tell you otherwise. And you can see
    the air rising over the land where the clouds form. Then they are carried
    south by the prevailing winds.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I've noticed that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Then the answer is clear: glide!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Oh, come on. You can't take a sailplane one
    hundred thousand kilometers! We don't even know if the wind is south all
    the way.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It's my guess that it is.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm not so sure. Still, you have to stop
    sometime. You need food, sleep. The best I've flown is about a thousand
    kilometers on a good day.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">A day? Do you mean a good Bannk? A good Bannk lasts
    six teclads. And the next Bannk is the longest, thirty per cent longer than
    this one. Yes, it is the Killer Bannk—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">A pleasant thought…I'd still have to land, and once
    I land that's it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">There certainly must be towns along the way. They
    could launch you with grask, as we will here. Grask, as you undoubtedly
    know, are very strong and can run very fast. There is no problem. In theory
    it should work.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">In theory.</q> Stringer got up and sat at the
    computer. he punched in a code to produce a map from the trip north. He fed
    in a scale to reduce the pictures to microfilm. He took a hand viewer from
    the cabinet. He clamped the viewing cassette to the output of the map
    maker, and when one hundred thousand kilometers' worth of microfilm had
    been fed into it, he took a quick look through the magnifier. A few minutes
    later he said, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, there are towns. We must have
    missed them on the way up because they were too small to see or because we
    were going so fast, or because of the haze. Maybe the surprising thing is
    that we saw Ta-tjenen. But they're there; the cameras caught them, even if
    they are no more than villages.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">So, you already have a map, I take it. All you have
    to do is land near the villages. Then up you go again with the help of a
    few grask.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer swiveled around in his seat. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We still
    need a sailplane. I might be able to build one. Pike made me fly in them
    often enough; they're similar to this shuttle in flight characteristics. I
    even had to take them apart and put them back together as training for
    emergencies. I think I could do it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">With my help. This should be an interesting
    project. All I've built so far are models.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'll have to check on the distances between
    towns.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I doubt you will find them far. Ta-tjenen was the
    first town, and how far do you think you can move a settlement in the Bannk
    before you die of the heat, before you must dig Under for the Patra? Moving
    on Patra-Bannks must be very slow. I've never met anyone from farther south
    than Godrhan, and I'll tell you this: I'm surprised your map showed any
    villages at all.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer smiled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So you didn't know. I suspected
    that. Well, I'll have to check more carefully. But even if all this manages
    to work, we still have one problem.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And what is that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">When is this sailplane going to get built?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane laughed his soft chuckle. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">There is a Short
    Patra ahead—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">—with you under and me Above.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">The Going Under is not for half a teclad yet—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But the teclads have been growing shorter, I've
    been told.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Remember,</q> said Alhane, holding up a finger, <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">this is the Weird Bannk, and even the sunset seems too
    long, even if it isn't. So we'll work on it. Right now I need your help
    with an experiment.</q> With that, Alhane dragged Stringer to his feet and
    they went off together to the citadel amid heavy rain and thunder.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Time Keeper's dwelling was on the outskirts of Ta-tjenen, close to the
    edge nearest Stringer's shuttle. When they reached it, Stringer was
    surprised to find quadrants and similar pieces of apparatus scattered
    around the yard. A miniature version of the great plaza sundial dominated
    the setting, the gnomon—useless now at Bannk's end—sticking straight out of
    the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Time Keeper pushed the door open and led Stringer inside, and Stringer
    almost laughed aloud. How unlike any Tjenen house he had seen before! The
    four rooms were amazingly cluttered. Parchments littered the floor and
    tables along with oddly shaped glassware. Models hung from the ceiling; a
    fire burned in a corner under a metal pan. A plank with insects stuck to it
    was propped up on a cabinet filled with great dusty notebooks. A faded
    portrait of a man and a woman dangled from the ceiling.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then there were the clocks. The workroom was filled with the ticking
    and buzzing of dozens of clocks standing on the floor, on shelves, on top of
    one another. Some glittered; others were dull and crudely built. One would
    click rapidly like a ratchet wheel, another would creak with rust, a third
    would drip water, drop by drop. Each seemed randomly placed about the room,
    and all said something randomly different. Stringer peered at one whose
    case was nothing more than a metal framework. Among its intricacies were
    two pinioned bars, intersecting, which oscillated in a vertical plane,
    first merging into one and then parting like butterfly wings. He moved to
    another where a horizontal beam swung forth and back again. Yet another was
    encased in glass, the first glass Stringer had seen in Ta-tjenen. A little
    ball, smaller than a marble, rolled down a sloping brass plate, its path a
    groove cut like a switchback road into the metal. The ball traveled always
    downward, first in one direction, then hitting a switchback, reversed
    itself in the twinkling of an eye, and continued its descent. When it
    finally reached bottom, the ball struck a little rod, a catch was released,
    the plate flipped up, and the ball began rolling in the new downward
    direction. An escapement mechanism then advanced a notch, and a small hand
    set inside a small circle moved a millimeter. As on all the clocks, there
    were seven scales, some dials, some linear, all unequally calibrated.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Time Keeper passed them off with a wave of his hand. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">They're all wrong, useless. Hardly a one keeps as good
    time as the sun. There's hardly a point in having clocks at all if they
    can't tell me when to come out at Bannkbreak.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane disappeared for a moment into one of the other rooms and returned
    with a reel of wire. Noting Stringer's surprise, he said, <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">From the Junk. Now, I'd thank you if you will come out
    into the rain again with me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane led stringer out to a windmill that stood near his house. Its giant
    eggbeaters whirled continuously in fury as the wind blew around loose bits
    of fern-moss and houses. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you see those two posts
    up there? The little ones jutting out? I'd ask you to attach these two
    wires to them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer took the wires and climbed up the wet, slippery scaffolding. He
    continuously ducked his head even though he knew that the blades were
    safely above him. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What are you doing?</q> he
    shouted as he dropped down.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You'll see even as I do!</q> Alhane scurried off,
    unreeling the twin wires over the muddy path back to his house. When
    Stringer returned inside, Alhane was standing over a tank of water. Two
    wires ran from the tank to a small open box sitting next to it. The box was
    filled with a black substance. The Time Keeper took the two wires that were
    running in from the windmill and placed two fingers across them. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Ouch! Lashgar is with us. Let's hope the wind keeps
    up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">A trivially easy wish.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">All right, then…</q> Alhane took one incoming wire
    and tied it to one from the tank. The other he pushed into the box near the
    second wire that was running out of the tank. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Aha! I
    think we have something here! Let's see if we cannot make it brighter.</q>
    He carefully moved one wire in the box closer to its partner. The water in
    the tank glowed. He moved the wire still nearer, and the water glowed
    brighter and brighter until it lit up the entire room. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Ahahahah! We have light, and not a little of it!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You've invented the dynamo?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">The what? I haven't invented anything. I just copied
    an old rusted thing I found in the Junk a few Patra-Bannks ago and saw what
    it could do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Is this water in the tank?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It's sea water. The process doesn't work with
    rainwater, so there must be something else here, too.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't think this works with Two-Bit sea
    water. At least I've never heard of such a thing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Well, then this isn't Two-Bit sea water, is it?
    Evidently we have an added ingredient, another chemical or microorganism,
    perhaps. To be truthful, I haven't the faintest idea of why it works at
    all—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't, either.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But you indicated you knew of such devices.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Dynamos? On my world things like that are taken
    for granted—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What good is taking something for granted?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer laughed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You're right. So now what will
    you do with it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What will we do with it? After that fire, we need
    all the fuel we can get. This will save all the fuel that normally goes for
    lighting. And the chances of suffocating go down, too. Do you realize how
    hard it is to ventilate the Under, especially with fires burning all over
    the place? We will have to start the installation this moment and no
    later.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, good luck, or Lashgar be with you, whichever
    you prefer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You won't help?</q> Alhane asked. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">That's very curious.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No. I'm not feeling very generous toward
    Ta-tjenen. I'd rather relax for the next few beclads and collect some
    supplies if I can.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">That is rather self-centered of you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, it is. But then, I'm not a Tjenen. Good-bye,
    Time Keeper; I hope I see you again sometime.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer left the house and thought he could dimly make out the outline of
    a sun growing large as it neared the horizon. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Moving again, I see,</q> Stringer said aloud. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">When will you learn to slow down? Do you ever hear
    me, Sun?</q> But the Sun just got lost in the thick gray clouds, leaving
    Stringer to wonder if he had seen it at all. A few paces behind him trotted
    Alhane in pursuit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Come on!</q> Alhane commanded with the curious
    squeak in his voice that appeared whenever he was excited. He grabbed
    Stringer's arm and pulled him toward the center of town.
  </p>

  <p>
    The plaza was filled with people standing in the heavy rain and wind, and
    more people arrived with every passing clad. Stringer pulled his cloak
    around him more tightly and it tangled in his legs. Alhane pushed him
    through the crowd to the meeting tent until they were inside. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Stay here!</q> he said, disappearing before Stringer
    could argue.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer did not know why he stayed. It was insane to remain here among so
    many enemies. But he did, one hand clenching the hood of his cloak around
    his face and the other resting on the hilt of his kalan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer was there. She had not noticed him. The others of the nestrexam
    gradually arrived, unaware, now that the sundial was useless, of exactly
    when they were expected. Finally the bell was sounded and the last
    stragglers squeezed their way in. Eventually, in the unhurried way of
    Ta-tjenen, things were ready, and a young man and woman came up to Kenken
    Wer, who stood at the Center.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer looked at them. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">So you are Gwyned, my
    third brother's son's first nesta.</q> Her raspy voice could hardly be
    heard over the wind and rain pounding on the tent and dribbling through the
    partly blocked apex hole.
  </p>

  <p>
    The girl nodded.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer turned to the table that had been set up behind her and spent a
    moment examining some lists. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Well, it seems that
    there are no problems. You are both on for at least the first half of the
    Parlztlu, correct?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gwyned">Yes,</q> the girl answered. <q
    ab:speaker="Gwyned">Here are the names.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer wiped off a splash of water that had fallen through a leak onto
    the Center and took the piece of paper. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Oh, yes, one
    last thing. When do you sleep?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="boy">Hmm,</q> the boy mused. <q ab:speaker="boy">I am
    currently sleeping around the third part of the beclad.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gwyned">And I the second.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">So we will put you in the two-three section for the
    moment, unless, of course, you want to live separately.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gwyned">No, we'll adjust to each other,</q> the girl
    replied.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">And naturally, you can shift sections if you find
    yourself getting out of phase with those around you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    So, Stringer thought, it looks as if underground Ta-tjenen was divided
    according to people's sleeping habits. Not a bad idea.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer looked up from the newly formed couple. <q
    ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Who's next?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen stepped forward and Stringer's knuckles turned white. He stepped
    behind a bystander and hoped she had not noticed him. He could see her
    clearly and was annoyed that she was always so beautiful without trying to
    be. Her hair was heavy with wetness and the drops sprinkled on her
    graskhide jacket.
  </p>

  <p>
     <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">So, Taljen,</q> Kenken Wer remarked, glancing
     at the lists. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">I see you are going off and will
     be unable to bear children this Parlztlu. What are your plans?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen brushed back her hair with nervous hands. She hesitated, then
    finished her reply in a rush: <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I want…I want the
    Alien.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer cackled. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">And will you breed with
    him?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The tent was filled with whirring laughter, and Stringer felt numb.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Besides,</q> Kenken Wer continued, spreading her
    palms, <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">the Alien is finally gone.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen shook her head. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">He is Returned.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Verlaxchi! That Polkraitz is Returned? Who
    murdered and who caused the fire that ruined us all? He is not dead and you
    want him as nesta?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen stood erect and pulled up her jacket. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes,</q> she said expressionlessly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Impossible. He must be exposed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It is my right to choose anyone because I am going
    off. If you refuse, I will stay Above also when you Go Under. It is that
    simple.</q> Taljen's voice remained soft, pitch level, little modulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer shook her fist in rage and turned to the others of the
    nestrexam. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">This is outrageous!</q> she
    screeched. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Is this to be permitted?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Several of the elder bowed their heads together. One finally spoke. <q
    ab:speaker="elder">Unless we want Taljen dead, we don't see what can be
    done. It is within her rights. She will have to be responsible for the
    Alien's actions, of course.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Ugh!</q> Kenken Wer slammed her fist down on the
    table and bent to the lists. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Your child will
    remain with Uslid or be given to another for this Parlztlu, unless, of
    course, you have plans for it, too.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I have no plans.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer could see the tears in Taljen's eyes as she turned from Kenken Wer
    and made her way through the crowd toward the exit. The Tjenens parted,
    stared as she went, kept their distance. She looked at each in turn as she
    walked by, and it was they who flinched, not she. Finally Stringer lost
    sight of her. He took one look at the great map hanging above him and
    followed her.
  </p>

  <p>
    He didn't find her until he reached the end of the plaza. She didn't hear
    him when he called her name. Not until he spun her around with hands
    clasped around her arms did she know he was there.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Taljen…</q> he began as the rain kept coming down
    and the thunder trundled its way across the sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Please, Stringer, I don't want to talk now.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't know why you have done this for me,
    but…I…I want to thank you.…Never…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen looked at Stringer, the way she always used to, and gazed deeply
    into his eyes. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Don't be sure, Alien, that I did it
    for you. Now leave me be.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer left her.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Twelve</div>And Back Again</h2>

  <p>
    The plain was dark, not a hair away from pitch-black. The giant shadow of
    the Massarat range had plunged the Great Desert into essential night. Only
    the sky directly above held any hint of quickly fading gray.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Number Two</em> sat stolidly at the base of the mountain, the gleaming
    of its hull quenched, its thirty meters made infinitesimal next to the
    twenty-kilometer-high peak. The plain was lightly covered with snow,
    representing what little moisture the air on that side of the mountain had
    managed to sneak over some of the lower peaks. The wind whipped it into
    snarls, curled and tightened it around the jagged rocks that littered the
    plain. Sand, too, was lifted by the wind and hurled against the shuttle
    with the snow. Pike listened, hypnotized, to the incessant assault on the
    hull. He would alternately nod off to sleep, lulled into drowsiness by the
    level <em>rat-a-tat-tat</em>, only to be awakened abruptly by a sudden gust
    of wind escalating the fierce clash of quartz and silicon against tarnished
    metal.
  </p>

  <p>
    He finally stood and switched on the front beam, pointing it up the
    slope. The light was lost on the rocks. It could have been ten meters or a
    hundred, even a thousand, and he wouldn't have been able to tell how far he
    was seeing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack paced the cabin in such agitation that one might have thought it
    feigned. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I don't understand you,</q> he said, as
    he had said many times before. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">First you risk our
    necks getting us out of Konndjlan, then we almost get killed trying to land
    in that incredible wind, and now you want to have us surely done in by
    climbing back onto that fortress. If we don't freeze on the mountain or
    blow off in this hurricane—the most likely thing that will happen—the
    Gostum will certainly have our heads once we find a way in.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No. If I am correct, they want us more than that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">If you are correct? Have you forgotten that they
    did their best to kill us when we tried to get out the first time?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Are you sure? Were they trying to kill us, or just
    keep us at Konndjlan?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack spun around. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Those wounds were
    certainly real!</q> he shouted, waving his arms. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">And what about Barbalan? Do you know what they will
    do to her? Do you have any idea?</q> He was standing without a shirt on,
    and his ribs looked as if they were doing their best to break through his
    skin.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike sat down again in the chair, letting his chest collapse in long
    exhalations. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I will take responsibility for
    Barbalan—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Empty promises! What good is responsibility if
    they kill her? What good is your fancy responsibility then?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">If they want us as much as I think they do, they will
    forgive Barbalan. In fact, I will make that a condition for our help.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Let me find out how she feels about this,</q>
    Paddelack said as he turned to Barbalan, who sat on the floor plaiting her
    long, shiny black hair. Her slender fingers ran through it unhindered,
    skillfully weaving and twining the strands. When she had braided up fully
    half her hair, she would just as dexterously untie it and begin again. She
    had said little since they left Daryephna, even less than usual, and when
    questioned about the strange room she had found and what Paddelack had
    taken to be the source of the Fear itself, she would—or could—say nothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, when questioned about her probably fate, she shrugged. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">He may be right. If he isn't, I will certainly die,
    but then I have little choice, do I? So what matters it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">They why did you help us?</q> Pike asked after her
    words had been translated. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Because of Paddelack?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack asked her. Barbalan did not stop unbraiding her hair. Indeed, it
    seemed as if that were her primary concern, not answering questions put to
    her. She did smile, faintly, to herself. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">Amusement. Boredom, perhaps. What is one to do as a
    Gostum other than train to fight unseen enemies? Why not put the training
    to use? What difference does it make? I got you out, now you go back.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike grinned. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well, I think it is time we got ready to
    climb. Rope, lights, tents, parkas…they're all in those storage cabinets. I
    am prepared.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">That's mighty fine. It's been cooling off here in
    the shade; night comes quickly over a desert, and I suspect it is fairly
    negative by now. Let's hope we can stand up in the wind.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Let's hope.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    For every meter they rose vertically, Pike estimated that they must have
    walked at least three times that horizontally, which made Konndjlan farther
    away than straight up. Barbalan had assured them that they were indeed on
    the path to Konndjlan, that she had recognized the narrow path that cut up
    the mountain. How she could be so sure, with the only evidence being some
    rocks under a lantern beam pointing the way, Pike did not know. How they
    had managed to find the right mountain in the fading light, Pike was not so
    sure, either. He <em>was</em> sure that they had been walking for
    hours. That was about the only thing of which he was certain, except that
    gravity was acting against them and that it was dark above and dark
    below. The wind was impossible, shrieking in their ears, making every step
    a dangerous one. The snow, whipped by the wind, was blinding. Pike was
    beginning to take for granted the frequent slips of feet on ice, and the
    aches in his bruised legs were no longer novel causes for complaint.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, hours after they had begun the climb, Pike collapsed. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Enough for tonight,</q> he shouted to Paddelack, tugging
    at the rope that attached him to his companions. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I
    can't go any farther.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">The night will still be with us when we've
    rested.</q> Paddelack began unfastening the tent from his back. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">But you're right, enough for now.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike tried to release the rope, but his hand stayed clenched around it,
    cramped or frozen or both. He was beginning to understand. Paddelack found
    a relatively quiet space between two large rocks that was sheltered from
    the wind, and pitched the tent. The tent, made of several layers of
    reinforced aluminized mylar, the same that Two-Bit Transportation used to
    ship liquid helium. It held heat well. Inside, Pike loosened his clothing,
    took off his boots, curled up into a corner, and fell asleep. Paddelack and
    Barbalan soon joined him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Indeed, when Pike awoke and cleared his eyes, the night had not left
    them. He knew by now, of course, that it would not leave them for more than
    another six months, maybe even seven, but the thought still made little
    sense to him. He tried to stretch his legs and found an almost paralyzed
    thigh. But as another pair of legs was lacking, these would have to do, and
    he set about exercising them. He broke open an unlabeled food packet and
    began munching on a crunchy wafer. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Tell me about the
    Gostum, Paddelack.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack yawned. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">All I know is that the Gostum
    were evicted from Triesk by a group led by a certain Lashgar. Evidently
    there was a split over where to set up the main base while waiting for the
    Polkraitz to return. Most of the Gostum, who originally seemed to have had
    some power over the Trieskans, were killed, but those that weren't came
    south to Liddlefur, the other colony that had been set up down here. Which
    means they must have had shuttles of some kind. Anyway, the Liddlefurans
    who were here already didn't seem to get along with the Gostum too well,
    either, so the Gostum moved over to Konndjlan, where they have been ever
    since. Up at Triesk? Who knows? I wonder if the place still exists. How
    would you like to face Patra-Bannk after a war when probably half your
    people are dead? Triesk probably died of exposure the first Patra—if not
    the first Bannk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And the Polkraitz themselves? The rulers, I take
    it. Who were they?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I guess those originally in charge of the
    operation here. Rulers? I don't know if that's the best term. But they
    left, that's for sure. The Gostum like to think the Polkraitz were on their
    side in the matter of where to maintain the base, but I don't know if
    that's true at all. Dates tend to blur when we look back, especially on
    Patra-Bannk, and I see no reason to view the Polkraitz and the Gostum as
    necessary contemporaries. Maybe they were, maybe they weren't. The two
    factions at Triesk could have developed after the Polkraitz left. Trouble
    with Polkraitz theorizing is that there's no evidence. You can make up any
    story you like and no one can disprove you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Does she know who they were?</q> asked Pike, ignoring
    Paddelack's admonition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack relayed the question. Barbalan shrugged. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">Who cares? They seem to have brought us to
    Patra-Bannk a long time ago and are not here any longer. Does it really
    matter?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike twisted his face in annoyance. <q ab:speaker="Pike">It matters if we
    are to find out what that city means. It matters if the Gostum think we are
    Polkraitz—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Does it?</q> Barbalan asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What do you mean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I don't think you are Polkraitz, whatever the
    Golun-Patra and other prophecies foretell. May people must think you
    Polkraitz, perhaps not. Even Fara-Ny, who is wise with age, who knows? But
    I tell you this: above all, anyone who survives on Patra-Bannk must be
    practical, and the Gostum are more practical people than those of
    Liddlefur and Massarat. Your presence will be made the most of, that I can
    foretell. So what matters it if you are really Polkraitz?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Doesn't anything matter to you?</q> Pike snapped. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">You help us escape Konndjlan seemingly just for fun, in
    disregard for your own life, come back in even more disregard, sit quietly
    while we abandon you for a city, get lost for weeks and think nothing of
    it, and now you say your entire history is of no consequence. What matters
    to you, anyway?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan chuckled, almost giggled. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">What you say
    may indeed be true, but only because it is so nonessential. I sit at
    Konndjlan and see the mountains rearing up mightily over my head and the
    Great Desert extending to the horizon and no doubt far beyond. You show me
    a Polkraitz map which shows that Triesk is one hundred thousand kilometers
    north of here, and then take me across an ocean half again as far as
    that. Some of the older Gostum argue the world is flat, even though the
    younger think otherwise because of that same map and the secret of the
    Fairtalian; at least this I am told. Flat or round, the size of Patra-Bannk
    is to me inconceivable. What does one hundred thousand kilometers mean to
    me? I have a hard enough time feeling the distance to the ocean, which is
    only several hundred. And yet, in addition, I am told the Polkraitz built
    great cities, like the one we saw, and roamed the Universe like
    yourselves. All this makes me feel even more insignificant, that nothing I
    can do really makes any difference whatsoever.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'm afraid that all sounds very negative and
    fatalistic,</q> interjected Pike thoughtfully.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Not at all. That is what is essential. My
    insignificance gives me the freedom to do what I like, unencumbered by
    worries of consequences. Knowing I mean so little frees me from fear of
    death, as my death means no more than the death of an ant.</q> Barbalan
    paused now, almost out of breath. She didn't think she had ever spoken so
    much at one time before. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">But I must admit that now
    I must stay alive and will have to be careful.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Why is that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I must get you two to Konndjlan.…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan lowered her head and released her hair, dropping her hands to the
    ground between her crossed legs. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">That is all.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The climb continued. Pike counted five hours in his head, but his body
    counted a hundred. Neither estimate made any sense. The path grew steeper,
    until it was becoming a real climb and not a walk. Snow was piled in drifts
    here, alternately covering and unveiling the sharp edges of rock and flat
    gray faces.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly Pike felt a tug on his rope and heard a shout near him. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">The path is ended. Rocks and snow block it. We have to
    make our own path here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    For a brief moment Pike thought that he was crazy trying to climb a
    mountain in the dark, in gale-force wind or greater, and in such biting
    cold. He tightened the hood around his face and made sure there was no
    exposed skin for the wind to make numb.
  </p>

  <p>
    A little while later, Paddelack scrambled to the top of a ledge with Pike's
    help, sat down, collapsed in a heap, and grumbled aloud: <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Has it occurred to you that we might miss
    Konndjlan entirely? We could already be on top of it for all I know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike leaned over and touched heads so that he could be heard without
    screaming his lungs out. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Have some faith, Paddy.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Faith in Lashgar? Certainly not in Sarek.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Faith in Barbalan and that she knows where she is
    going, I'd say.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Barbalan?</q> Paddelack looked around. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Where is she?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">A little ahead, I assumed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack grabbed the rope that attached Pike to Barbalan and pulled. It
    came away slack. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What the—</q> He pulled again
    until he reached the end of the rope, clip and all. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">It didn't break—how could this stuff break?—it's
    unfastened.</q> Paddelack scanned the rock wall with his lantern. Snow
    here, snow there. Just rock and snow. He rushed ahead, unthinking. More
    snow. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Barbalan! Can you hear me? Barbalan!</q>
    There was no answer except the shriek of the wind.
  </p>

  <p>
    He knelt at the snowbank and found a small hole from which he had pulled
    the rope. He began digging. Pike bent to his knees and flung the snow out
    behind him, only to have it blown back by the wind. The snow was soft,
    loosely packed. Could there have been a slide? Paddelack became frantic. He
    cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted: <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Barbalan, if you can hear me, try to move. Maybe the
    snow will shift and we will see where you are.</q> They dug for a telclad
    more and found nothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I don't think she is here,</q> Pike announced flatly
    as he sat back against the ledge.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Where else could she be? There might be a deep
    gulley here. She could have fallen in and then the snow piled on top of
    her.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I don't think it is that deep,</q> Pike shouted back
    over the howling wind. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I think she is gone. She was
    worried about what might happen to her at Konndjlan. Perhaps she just
    unfastened the rope and ran away, Paddy. That is conceivable, her cockeyed
    philosophy notwithstanding.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">A Gostum? Even with her philosophy, a Gostum
    afraid of death? Gostum are afraid of little, least of all dying.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">She did say she had to stay alive.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I didn't understand that at all.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Look, she's either dead or gone. You
    can't have it both ways. And in either case, there is nothing we can do
    about it. I suggest we settle down for a few hours and see if she comes
    back.</q> Pike brushed the snow off himself, found a sheltered position
    under an overhang, and began unpacking the tent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack said nothing as he climbed in. He took off only his hood and fell
    into a fitful sleep.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    When Pike awoke, his companion had evidently been long up. Pike took some
    food from his pack and ate in silence.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Doesn't it even bother you that she's gone?</q>
    Paddelack finally broke out, close to tears.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike cleared his throat. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Of course. She was very
    helpful and I certainly appreciated her company. But she is gone now and I
    don't see what we can do about it, except go on.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Go on? Go where? We don't have the faintest idea
    of where we are going! We could climb forever and miss that fortress in the
    dark.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">We will go on and try to find Konndjlan.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You can kill yourself for all I care, but I won't
    let you kill me! This is a wild-goose chase.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You know I'm doing this for your own good. This is the
    only way to get to what we seek: the metallic hydrogen, and the only way to
    get you off Patra-Bannk. But look, I'll trade a bronze with you; first
    we'll look for Barbalan again. If we don't find her, we continue for…for
    one more day. If we don't sight Konndjlan today, we turn back.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Today? Do you mean a Patra-Bannk day?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Don't go nonlinear! Do you think I like putting up
    with your blatherings? Within the next six hours, or whatever the
    equivalent.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack began to tremble. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Long ago I forgot
    what an hour was.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan was dead or missing. That was an easy conclusion to reach, as
    there were no other possibilities. Paddelack became deadly silent and would
    not speak at all. Pike wandered about with his lamp, trying to find a way
    out of a dead end in which they had trapped themselves. He passed the beam
    over a rock wall and spotted a small chimney extending upward.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I think there is a path less than ten meters above
    us,</q> he said, grabbing Paddelack. Pike wasn't sure he believed it
    himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike wedged himself in the chimney and began to shinny up with short
    thrusts of his legs. Paddelack followed, moving slowly. Pike bent to give
    him a hand as he emerged, struggling, from the top.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike's eyes met another rock wall, this one extending upward
    indefinitely. He heard himself sigh. The snow was piled high in places or
    blown away completely. The beam cut through the swirling white, seemed to
    bend itself in the terrific gale. Pike swung once and back again. The light
    caught a tall, cylindrical object and separated it out from the gorge
    wall. The guard turret. The road to Massarat. They were at the Konndjlan
    gate. Pike remembered his swift ride in the opposite direction several
    months earlier and smiled in a brief moment of nostalgia for adventures
    past.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">We were right underneath it all the time!</q>
    Paddelack exclaimed. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I'll bet Barbalan went on
    ahead.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike didn't bet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another swing of the light showed that the gate was open. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Curious that they should leave it open, wouldn't you
    say?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Hmm,</q> Paddelack replied, <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">not so sure. They wouldn't have been expecting
    invaders now—if they ever do; the drawbridge is open, anyway, probably to
    keep the weight of the snow off it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Perhaps you're right.</q> Pike walked through the
    gate, untrusting eyes on the slab hanging above his head. The slab let him
    pass unharmed. No Gostum leaped out to attack him. The only sound was the
    whipping of the wind through the narrow gorge. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Now,
    how do we get across that gap?</q> he mumbled, already knowing the answer.

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">The same way we did last time.</q> Paddelack
    unslung the rope from his shoulder.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Thanks.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">If Barbalan came this way,</q> Pike said once he
    was on the other side of the crevice, <q ab:speaker="Pike">then she walked
    very lightly—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">—or the wind blew away her footprints.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Believe what you like.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Within a moment they were at the lift. Even in the dark the cliff wall
    didn't look as high as it did when the Gostum had descended with them. They
    went up, cranking away at the winch—obviously repaired in their
    absence. The lift jerked to a halt at their destination.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well, here we are, do you believe it?</q> Pike turned
    to enter the tunnel was was confronted by a massive wooden door strapped
    with iron and impregnated with bolts. It was not a door to be broken. They
    searched for an opening mechanism. But if one existed, it was well hidden
    in the dark.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Should have expected this, I supposed,</q>
    Paddelack said as he sat down on the lift. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Can
    always blast it out if you're anxious.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Not very elegant, I'd say.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">We haven't been elegant in anything we've done so
    far; why worry about it now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">One is elegant when the situation presents itself for
    an elegant solution.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">And how do you know when that occasion arises?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Take this situation, for instance. It seems to me that
    an elegant solution will present itself shortly, so I shall just wait for
    it to come to me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack leans back against the wall. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Good
    luck,</q> he said dryly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just then the door swung open in the middle and two armed Gostum, clothed
    in heavy parkas, appeared. Paddelack jumped up, his hand on his
    holster. Pike remained motionless.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Hold on,</q> he said, steadying Paddelack.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Gostum motioned the two men to enter and did nothing to harm them.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">How did you know?</q> Paddelack gasped.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">To quote an oft-repeated phrase by a well-known
    colleague: They're Gostum, aren't they?</q> Pike grinned under his hood. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Elegant enough for you? Try being a poet occasionally; it
    will do you good.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack remained thoughtfully silent and followed the Gostum into
    Konndjlan.
  </p>

  <p>
    The guards were silent as they led the Aliens through two more doors and
    finally up the moving floor.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">They really are concerned with security,</q> Pike
    remarked as they passed through a third door. He unzippered his hood.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">No, just insulation.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The stables were filled with hundreds of grask and the balcony above was
    lined with Gostum, all dressed heavily. Pike could see his breath expand
    into the cavern. The old leader called Fara-Ny shuffled forward, burdened
    by clothing as well as by age. The other Gostum parted as he walked down
    the ramp, and he brushed them aside with a long sweep of his hand. The
    young blond-haired Effrulyn was never far from his side, but his eyes were
    never near.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">Let me admire your escape,</q> Fara-Ny said. <q
    ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">Such has rarely been accomplished.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike glanced at Paddelack.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">He says he liked our escape,</q> Paddelack told
    him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">At least he has good taste.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Has Barbalan returned here?</q> Paddelack asked
    carefully.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">No, she has not, and it is well for her that she
    has not,</q> Fara-Ny leaned on his walking staff, the two-meter-long rod
    that stood taller by an arm's length than Fara-Ny himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Tell him that we have come to give consideration to
    the Triesk matter.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack translated.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fara-Ny did not change his expression; he stood there as if he had heard
    nothing. <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">We expected as much. Is he the
    Commander?</q> he asked Paddelack, pointing a long fingernail at Pike.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack smirked. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Yes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">Good. Let us then adjourn to warmer quarters where
    the fires are burning and our breath is invisible.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack and Pike were taken to the same room in which they had been kept
    before. A great fire burned in the corner, funneling its suffocating smoke
    up a chimney to places unknown. Nonetheless, a small bird was caged near
    the fire to serve as an early warning for any troubles. Pike walked slowly
    to the pool and removed a soiled glove and dipped his hand into the
    blue-tinted water. It was heated.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">Suitable clothes will be brought for you here,</q>
    Fara-Ny said, and left them alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">A splendid prison, didn't I tell you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Much better than the <em>Crimson</em> for the Patra,
    and I think we might enjoy it this time, if we don't get
    claustrophobic.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Even better than Massarat, and I hope we know
    what we are getting into.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike stretched out on one of the large red cushions and sank down as to
    become almost invisible. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Look,</q> he said, voice
    rising out of the valley, <q ab:speaker="Pike">we want to get to
    Triesk. Staying here is better than staying on the <em>Crimson</em> or, as
    you said, Massarat. When the Patra is over, we'll fly up there for a few
    days and find out whatever it is that they want us to find out.</q> Pike
    thought about the ships under Daryephna. Did that make sense? Yes, he
    thought it did. <q ab:speaker="Pike">There may be nothing there that can be
    useful to the Gostum, but it is worth the winter here to satisfy their
    curiosity.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack swirled the water in the pool and rubbed his legs with a coarse
    sponge. He spat out a mouthful of water. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I've
    told you before not to underestimate the Gostum. I'm telling you that again
    right now. I don't know what is at Triesk; I don't know if anything is
    there at all. But I do know that the Gostum won't stop looking for it until
    Triesk is a heap of ashes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Don't be nonsensical…</q> Pike said absently, and
    began to fall asleep.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he awoke he was surrounded by three male Gostum, including the
    mathematician. The blond-haired boy scowled when Pike winked an eye at him
    and motioned the others to put down their heavy burdens. Paddelack got up
    when two servants approached him, and he let them dress him. His attendant
    took a long tunic of gray off his right arm, placed it over Paddelack's
    head, and tied it in front. The tunic was coarse and scratchy, and
    Paddelack hitched his shoulders in an attempt to remove the discomfort. The
    Gostum then unfolded a long blue robe, deep inky-blue edged with elaborate
    golden embroidery. The gold was tinged with red, flames that shot up into a
    late-evening sky. Paddelack was pleased as he slipped his arm into the
    loose sleeve. Slippers: wooden, soled hard, but with sewn-in socks and
    laced with leather. Paddelack wished he had a mirror in which to admire
    himself, until he saw Pike.
  </p>

  <p>
    An emerald-green robe hung heavily from his companion's shoulders, trailing
    on the floor but not concealing the outline of his muscular body. The green
    became crisscrossed with gleaming metal as, with infinite care, a
    shimmering net was lowered over his neck. On his back was placed a grask
    hide, the strands of the rare black breed falling across his shoulders down
    to his forearm.
  </p>

  <p>
    The two men stared at each other with eyes wide open, not laughing, not
    believing, either. Effrulyn beckoned them toward the doorway. Paddelack
    took a step in that direction, but Effrulyn's hand stayed him until Pike
    had passed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The passageway was lined with torches. A draft carried their sooty smoke
    with it. Below each torch stood a Gostum, each one silent, their faces
    craggy landscapes in the flickering orange.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn led them past the torches, through recently familiar corridors to
    the big council chamber. The line of Gostum stretched off behind them, each
    guard taking his place in the march as Pike and Paddelack strode by.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike glanced at Paddelack for some information, but Paddelack only shook
    his head.
  </p>

  <p>
    They entered the hall and Pike once again noted the relief carved around
    the upper perimeter. Figures crouching at one end, a formless mass, growing
    more distinct and standing apart as the scene progressed along the
    wall. Always clusters of one, two…seven, Pike counted. Now Fara-Ny stood
    opposite him, beckoning with a gnarled finger, surrounded by cross-legged
    Gostum seated on the floor. Behind Fara-Ny two clocks were now raised. One
    Pike had seen before, short and squat, lying on a table; the other was new
    to him, tall and slender, marked by a slowly swinging pendulum. Effrulyn
    took his place next to Fara-Ny and dropped the Angles on their special
    stand. He bent down to them, head out of sight, and remained obscure until
    his nod was seen by Fara-Ny.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">You will both stand here,</q> Fara-Ny said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">And you will translate as well,</q> Paddelack
    heard the whisper in his ear.
  </p>

  <p>
    Softly at first, invisibly slowly, Pike heard the pulse begin. <em>Thump
    thump thump</em>, then again; three distinct pitches: low, high, down a
    little. <em>Thump thump thump</em>…Now a change: <em>thump</em> space
    <em>thump thump</em>, all the same pitch. Then both together, and the cycle
    repeated itself after an undetermined time. The torches continued to
    flicker undisturbed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fara-Ny put out his hand toward the two men and began a chant, in curious
    asynchronism with the drums, in constant opposition to the
    <em>click-clack</em> of the great pendulum clock, all pounding in Pike's
    head. Paddelack whispered after Fara-Ny, first out of rhythm, then catching
    up, then falling behind once more.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike felt as if he were suspended in space and time, unable to move. A ruby
    ring was thrust upon his finger, scraping the skin. A golden bracelet,
    thick and heavy, was placed round one wrist. His throat was encircled by a
    dull gray necklace, bound with a stab of fire searing the neck. Into his
    right hand was thrust an iron spear, rusted, corroded with age. A helmet
    encrusted with jewels was placed on his head. And at the end, after
    uncounted ages, a black ring of uncut obsidian found its place on his
    forefinger, and the word <q>Commander</q> rang in his ears.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Thirteen</div>Turn Back the Clock:
  A Girl Alone</h2>

  <p>
    Barbalan remained silent, breathing only softly until she heard Paddelack
    and Pike give up their furious digging and enter their tent. She was glad
    that she would not have to listen to them any longer. If they couldn't find
    Konndjlan now that it was right on top of them, they deserved their fate.
  </p>

  <p>
    She started down the mountain with only her lantern, the cruel whistle of
    the wind, and her thoughts to keep her company. The way was easier alone
    without those two to look after but was still dangerous enough; a careless
    step or an unguarded moment could mean victory for the cold and wild and
    ice. But Barbalan did not stop to wonder if she would survive the downward
    climb or the fifty-kilometer trek she must make before she reached
    safety. Only one thing was certain: Death awaited her at
    Konndjlan. However, she had delivered Pike there, and there he would stay
    until the Patra was past. Now her job was to reach the Fringe, as Pike had
    proved so uncooperative at Daryephna. Would he even awaken? Had any
    impression been made on his mind at all? Barbalan did not know, and she did
    not know how to find out; she must search elsewhere.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her Gostum feet, strong and agile, guided her safely until she found
    <em>Number Two</em> at the base of the mountain. She unlocked the hatch,
    briefly found some food to satisfy her crying stomach, and undressed. The
    hot water of the shower was soothing to her nearly paralyzed legs, and she
    massaged them for a long time before she went to sleep.
  </p>

  <p>
    When she awoke, her legs were little more than immobile, the shower
    notwithstanding. But she had to go. A quick meal was all that she allowed
    herself before she readied to depart. Now she took off the necklace and
    knew that this was the right time to make use of it. She lined up the bezel
    with the westward-pointing needle and saw the arrow marking the direction
    to the stala. If she was off by more than a hair, she would wander in the
    night until she died. Dying had never bothered her much; on Patra-Bannk, to
    worry about dying when the possibility was always by your side was
    pointless. Except now she was bothered by the possibility, not by the
    thought of any unpleasant sensation at the end, but by the thought that
    something would be left unfinished. This was the first time in her life
    that Barbalan knew something had to be finished. So the thought of dying did
    bother her. If she died now, she would not be able to reach Pant and find
    the other Alien who had escaped there. And that was what was important.
  </p>

  <p>
    She wished, as she bent low in her struggles across the wind-torn desert,
    that her mind would go blank and leave her. Memories of the building she
    had stumbled on at Daryephna attacked her unconscious mind just as the sand
    whipped up and attacked her parka. She had only a vague recollection of
    what had actually happened: she had gone into the room; the lights had been
    on and she became unconscious. When she awoke she was starving, but someone
    or something said that it understood what kind of food she needed, and
    could make it, and told her where to get it. She stayed in the room for a
    long time, beclads on end, eating and sleeping…she wasn't sure what
    else. When she finally left, there was a message in her head. It was simple
    and final: you cannot do it alone. Get help from the Aliens you know. Bring
    them to Neberdjer. Exactly what she could not do along, she did not
    understand; the words were not even in her vocabulary. She assumed that
    whoever or whatever the demon was who talked with her, he had discovered
    her limitations while she was asleep. Had she talked with him in dream
    language? In her own? What or where Neberdjer was, she wasn't sure, either,
    so she had brought Pike back to the same place. He had crumpled. Had
    nothing of the experience remained in his head? Or hadn't there been enough
    time? Was he just not talking about it? If she had been he, Barbalan
    wouldn't have wanted to talk about it, either. At first the experience had
    not been pleasant, although afterward it induced euphoria. Or at least the
    dreams were colorful.
  </p>

  <p>
    So now the only thing left to do was to act on rumor. Rumors escaping from
    loose Fairtalian tongues after a loose time in bed. A third Alien, captured
    at Triesk, had been brought to Pant on his way to Konndjlan but had somehow
    managed to escape at the stopover. Barbalan wasn't exactly sure where Pant
    was, which made her very unsure of anything at this point. She had been
    taken there once, blindfolded, so she knew it did exist. It was another
    Gostum outpost, newer than Konndjlan; only several belbannks had passed
    since it had been discovered by the Fairtalian and settled. In any case, no
    matter where Pant was, be it five thousand kilometers away or fifty
    thousand, that was where she was going, unless she died first.
  </p>

  <p>
    Telclads later, she passed the shadowy form of a large, craggy monolith
    protruding from the desert floor. According to the map, it was the only
    landmark on the way to the stala. She stopped there, putting down her
    walking pole which kept her from being blown over, and rested. After a
    little while, not wanting to waste time, she readjusted the bezel as the
    instructions indicated and set off in a slightly different direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, as unbelievable as the mountain climb, there it was. For once,
    Barbalan allowed herself a smile and was glad that she was a Gostum. How
    else would she have been able to pinpoint the stala in blinding sand and
    Patra? The compass? Perhaps that had helped, but being a Gostum helped even
    more. Her lantern revealed the stala to be a very large, circular
    structure, too smooth to be anything other than artificial. It sat on what
    seemed to be a large, raised plaza with walkways leading down it in all
    directions to—nowhere. She followed one of the walkways out, and it did,
    indeed, stop at nowhere. She returned by the same walkway to the circular
    building and found the entrance clearly marked. It took her a moment to
    realize she was actually reading one of the lines of lettering, even though
    it was in a completely unknown language. There were other letters, too, but
    those she still could not read, since they were in yet other languages. The
    sign was lit. It said: <em>Enter</em>, and she did.
  </p>

  <p>
    Naturally, it was light inside. The Polkraitz must have been wonderful to make
    magic like this. Barbalan wondered why all the magic was here and at
    Daryephna and so little was left at Konndjlan. All the work of magic there
    was left to Effrulyn and his antagonists.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan at once recognized that the huge cylindrical map was virtually
    identical to the one she had seen at Daryephna. It towered over her head
    and was also so deftly constructed that the faraway points at the top
    seemed as close as the others. So this must be the way to get from one
    place to another. She turned her head and saw the lines crisscrossing the
    map. Somehow she knew how to work this thing. Both the necklace and
    Neberdjer had told her. It was now simply a matter of pushing the right
    buttons. But that didn't tell her how to find Pant. From her pouch she
    fished out the card in the pendant and looked again at that curious table
    she had puzzled over at Daryephna. If its meaning was incomprehensible
    before, she could now at least make a good guess. Her eyes drifted down to
    the base of the illuminated world and halted at the rows of colored bars
    beneath it. Although no bar was labeled Pant in this new alphabet that
    suddenly seemed vaguely familiar, she guessed the correct bar from the
    pendant card. At her touch, a light on the map above her head went on. Pant
    could very well be there, who could tell? It wasn't very far on this
    scale. To her left, underneath and beyond the huge raised cylinder, a door
    opened. Barbalan didn't bother to hesitate; the only things behind her were
    the desert, the cold, and an unfriendly Konndjlan. The door slid shut
    behind her.
  </p>

  <p>
    The floor was flat, but the room itself had curved walls that arched over
    her head. It was big enough to hold twenty or thirty people, and
    comfortable-looking furniture was scattered about. She walked over to a
    cabinet, opened it, and found spacesuits, some like the ones Pike had,
    others not. Barbalan sat down just as she felt a downward acceleration,
    then a slight bump, a push, then nothing at all. Just silence
    now. Remembering her blindfolded journey, she knew that the trip would take
    some time and began to massage her legs. She worked herself over
    unmercifully until her leg muscles had untensed and her arms slowed
    themselves to sleep.
  </p>

  <p>
    Very nearly ten telclads later, although Barbalan didn't know that at the
    time, a slight thud awakened her. A very short time after that, the door
    opened, and she thought she might never have left the other stala. But she
    guessed that she was now really at Pant. Pant of the north? North of Pant
    was the Fringe, hardly explored at all. Still farther north, so she had
    been told, was Triesk, even beyond the Fringe. Barbalan once again looked
    at the map to try to get an idea of how far one thing was from another; she
    saw that Pant lay about halfway between Konndjlan and another dot on the
    map. Was that one Triesk? She didn't know. In fact, she didn't really know
    how to tell which way was north or which was south.
  </p>

  <p>
    She tightened her parka and boots, less cumbersome than the Gostum
    quazzats, this Alien clothing, and left stala-Pant. The subfreezing air
    stung a bit of carelessly exposed flesh and she wrapped herself up
    closer. The Patra had not been with them long, but the snow was already
    deep and the cold was deeper. Worst of all was the wind, which could toss
    one to the ground and make each step seem a trial that lasted forever. She
    swung her lantern around and saw buildings everywhere, deep in snow. Surely
    the Gostum would be underground now, and she had to find them or she would
    freeze to death very shortly. On the other hand, if word had by then been
    passed on to Pant that she was a traitor and she was recognized, she would
    be killed on sight. But freezing was a certainty, the other was not.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wind howled and shrieked, but Barbalan continued the search—on her
    knees at times—until she found what she was looking for: a gateway. It was
    marked as such, as all gateways were. She rang the bell and soon the heavy
    wooden door swung inward taking a heap of snow with it. She stepped in,
    showing her necklace. Only Fairtalian could make the trip to Pant alone. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">I'm here with special orders to find the Alien who
    escaped. Do you have him? Was he recaptured?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The short Gostum facing her shook his warted face and quickly closed the
    door until it was open only a crack. <q ab:speaker="short Gostum">No. I
    know little enough about it. Do you expect to find him out there? I thought
    you were a fugitive Trieskan, the way you were walking about. The cold is
    only for unruly prisoners.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">That I know. Then I will have to stay here for the
    Patra until I can search for him at Bannk's beginning.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="short Gostum">Then come in before you freeze us all.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan smiled and accepted the invitation.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Fourteen</div>Again Turn Back the
  Clock: The Night Begins</h2>

  <p>
    The line to the central gateway was a long one, and it moved slowly. The
    central gateway was more often known simply as the Gateway. It was highly
    ornamented, as old as anything or older in this city barren of
    ornaments. The path that led to it from the outer edge of the plaza sloped
    gently downward until it met the thick wood and metal doors inset into the
    archway. Stringer glanced at the motto cut into the stone above his head:
    <em>You who are entering, don't be sad; you who are leaving, don't
    rejoice.</em> The motto struck a familiar ring to Stringer, and he decided
    that it was more appropriate here than on Two-Bit.
  </p>

  <p>
    He stood there with an unlit candle hidden beneath his cloak to protect it
    from the fierce winds and cold rain that lashed about him in all
    directions. Already a number of houses had collapsed, and netting blew
    across the ground. High above his head thunder rolled through the air, 
    crossing the sky from horizon to far horizon, metallic-sounding, as if
    enclosed in a giant pipe. The sky was black and gray; snow would be coming
    soon, but they would be Under before then. Lightning streaked the sky with
    the thunder. Lightning at this time of year? It made little sense to
    Stringer, but then it made little sense to call a Bannk a year. Ta-tjenen
    shook a moment later from a new barrage of heaven-rumbling.
  </p>

  <p>
    The checkpoint moved closer all the time, step by step, monotonically
    toward the Patra. Suddenly four figures emerged, traveling in the opposite
    direction from the crowd. One tugged violently, but his three guards
    overpowered him and kept him moving.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nudged the person ahead of him in line. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Who's that? What's going on?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer wondered if the woman who answered him knew who had questioned
    her. <q ab:speaker="Tjenen woman">He is a Gostum spy. He was seen
    consorting with the missing Gostum during the Festival and is being
    exposed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What? I never heard about that. No one—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer.</q> The soft voice behind him was
    Taljen's.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What?</q> Stringer said, looking over his shoulder
    at the man being carried away. He hadn't spoken to Taljen since the
    Parlztluzan, several beclads ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Have you decided where you are staying?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">With Alhane.</q> The man was nearly across the
    plaza now, still struggling.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">We can live together if you wish. That is usually
    done between nestas.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The prisoner collapsed, and Stringer saw him being dragged away,
    unconscious, beyond the now fully closed pod-trees in the park. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">So that is what you had in mind for me. You're just
    going to let him die out there. If not me, you need another victim. Do you
    sacrifice an unwitting stooge to every Patra? A Gostum spy! That is the
    feeblest excuse for an execution I've ever heard of.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was at the Gateway now. Alhane, the Time Keeper, as was his duty,
    lit Stringer's candle. Stringer looked down the passageway and saw many
    flickering candles dotting the darkness.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Name?</q> The checker looked up. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">Never mind.</q> It was Benjfold, who quickly turned
    back to the list.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, I'm sure you haven't forgotten.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer…</q> Taljen said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'll think about it.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I can't find anything wrong,</q> Stringer said
    after he had finished checking the entire passageway. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">The trouble must be Above.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">After all the work we did!</q> Alhane sighed,
    glancing down at the dead tank. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I ask you, is that a
    just reward?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What did you expect for a first try? We didn't
    have much time and there were bound to be problems. I say we go up. I
    remember which windmill I connected these to.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane hesitated. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">This is probably the worst time to
    go up, between Bannk and Patra. You may never come back.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you want light?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane nodded.
  </p>

  <p>
    They found their way up to the top level and to the Gateway room and began
    to put on thick graskhide parks and boots. Then Alhane got a rope and
    hooked Stringer and himself together. The inner doors slid open easily, but
    the outer one was stuck. After Stringer kicked it several times, the door
    jarred loose and they pulled it open. A gust of wind almost took Stringer
    off his feet, and the snow that blew in almost blinded him. They forced
    their way out and were buffeted about by hurricane-strength winds carrying
    stinging snow. Alhane's lamp blew out immediately, but Stringer had brought
    his own lantern, which was not the type that would blow out.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And we've only been Under four beclads!</q>
    Stringer shouted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane didn't hear him. A giant thunderclap shook the plaza and they fell
    to the ground. Stringer stood up shakily to see, dimly, half the roof of
    the giant meeting tent being torn away and smashed onto the plaza. Drifts
    of snow lapped around the pillars that had once held a solid roof. Another
    bolt of lightning and thunder followed at an imperceptible delay, and
    Stringer, struggling to his feet again, saw one of the pod-trees in the
    park collapse. Now the lightning flashed continuously, so fast that Alhane
    and he moved in stroboscopic motion. Stringer did not think he had ever
    been so frightened.
  </p>

  <p>
    He pulled the rope and tugged Alhane to his feet. They trudged slowly
    toward the windmill they were seeking. The passed several empty houses,
    most of which had large gashes torn into their sides. The nets that held
    them creaked with the strain, and the ropes were frayed, ready to give way
    soon. As they continued down the street, following the guy lines that
    crisscrossed Ta-tjenen, Stringer suddenly shouted to Alhane, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Duck!</q> He yanked the older man down just as an
    entire house was ripped from its foundations and sailed by them into
    another dwelling, which crumbled under the impact. They reached the
    windmill after a telclad of struggling and found its blades spinning so
    fast that Stringer expected it to fly away. As he was walking up to it, he
    thought he heard a voice.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Was that you, Alhane?</q> he shouted, trying to
    carry his voice above the wind.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No, what?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Listen!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Tjenen exile">Help me!</q> The cry was faint.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer peered into the nearest house whose door had been torn off. Snow
    was piling on the inside, where a vague figure clothed in graskhide was
    slumped on the floor. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The exile!</q> Stringer
    unclasped the rope that tied him to Alhane and ran into the house. His
    lantern dispersed the shadows and illuminated the scene. The man was still
    alive, but by how much Stringer couldn't tell. He bent down to the
    curled-up figure. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Can you walk if I help you?</q>
    The man nodded, but Stringer didn't believe him. He put his arms under the
    exile's shoulders and pulled him to his feet.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What are you doing?</q> cried Alhane, who had
    climbed into the house. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You can't help him. He is in
    exile.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you expect me to leave him here?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You can't take him Under. All of us would be thrown
    out for sure.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Then I won't take him Under.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What can you do? It is against all the rules.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You are a hateful people who claim you don't know
    what it means not to cooperate. Well, that obviously applies only to the
    straight and narrow. Now, if you don't get out of my way, I'll knock you
    out of that door and you won't get back up again!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane backed away, speechless.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Wait in here. I'll be back as soon as I can.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer hobbled by, the exile's heavy body leaning against his own. After
    being blown off the citadel stairs more than once and climbing over more
    than a few felled trees, they finally reached <em>Number One</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer took the prisoner through the cockpit into the main section of the
    shuttle, the cargo and passenger area. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Look, do
    you understand me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The man nodded.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't have time to show you how everything
    works.</q> He opened a storage bin and removed some food. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Here is the food. You open it like this—are you
    listening?</q> Stringer slapped the man on the face and he nodded
    again. Stringer walked over to the cabin controls. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Look, I don't know if there is enough fuel left to
    keep the cabin warm throughout the Patra. Keep the temperature as low as
    you can to conserve fuel. Do it with this, see? The toilet is back
    there. Figure it out yourself. This tent here,</q> he said, unfurling the
    aluminized plastic, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">is an excellent
    insulator. Sleep in it if you have to. The cabin won't freeze unless the
    fuel runs out or you do something stupid, like open a door. See these jugs?
    Water. Melt snow if they run out, which means you will have to open a
    door. Then make sure this one is closed before you open the outer one. Do
    you understand?</q> Stringer shoved some food into the exile's mouth. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">You'd better understand. Good luck, exile, to both of
    us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane was still waiting in the abandoned house when Stringer returned. They
    did not speak. Stringer climbed up the scaffolding and saw that the
    generator box had been improperly closed. He spent a few minutes with a
    hammer and chisel, unjamming the ice that had frozen the rotor fast. Then
    he climbed down, job completed.
  </p>

  <p>
    On their way back to the Gateway, Stringer looked eastward into the
    darkening sky painted with lightning and thunder. He could not see the sun;
    he did not even known if it had set yet. But he was sure the Patra had
    finally arrived.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The room was small, with no more than a wooden partition separating it from
    the next dwelling. It was crammed with the only bed in Ta-tjenen, a desk,
    and two chairs, one of which always managed to wedge itself between table
    and bed. Stringer tried to ignore the ceaseless conversation going on in
    the next room, revolving around that favorite Tjenen topic of discussion,
    the makeup of the current nestrexas. Was that Taljen's name mentioned for
    the dozenth time? Stringer shivered. Fuel rations were being reduced. He
    brought his attention back to Alhane, who was studying a large piece of
    parchment that was spread across the table. His skin looked colorless in
    the queer light from the glowing tank.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer thought he had waited the appropriate pause, and now he leaned
    toward the Time Keeper and said, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">…and have
    <em>you</em> ever considered going south?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane sighed. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Many times. Patra-Bannk seems to be
    larger than I expected, and I imagine there is much to see.…But I'm getting
    too old for that sort of trip, I'll have to be truthful on that
    account. Still, you must take someone.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I need all the glide ratio I can get. That may be
    the crucial factor on this trip. And there's no one here for whom it's
    worth sacrificing those extra kilometers except you—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Impetuous Stringer!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Otherwise it's me, my tent, and my rodoft—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Take Taljen,</q> Alhane said bluntly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer curled his lip under his teeth and stood up. He wandered into
    Alhane's second room, a privilege that only Alhane, as Time Keeper, and a
    few others were allowed. In it Alhane's clocks were buzzing and grinding
    away, whirring and clacking. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Taljen and I haven't
    spoken in…in who knows how long?</q> Stringer stopped and looked about. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">None of your clocks seem to agree with any of the
    others, and there doesn't seem to be any other way of finding out. Who
    knows how long we've been cooped up here? You might as well take my watch
    for all the good it will do you. At least it runs constantly.</q> He pulled
    his watch off his belt and threw it on the table in front of the Time
    Keeper's eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The silver-haired man picked the thing up and scrutinized it carefully,
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How do you know that Taljen would even want to
    come?</q> Stringer asked, picking up his monologue.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I don't know that she would. Certainly no one else
    would risk it—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">—but the Time Keeper.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane craned his head up at Stringer. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you think
    we would get along well enough together? I thought you would kill me that
    time we went Above.</q> 
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I think you're the only person I could get along
    with. No one else seems to want to have anything to do with me. I eat
    alone, sleep alone, work—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">That's mostly your own fault. Also, you have no
    nestrexa of your own, so you are not accepted.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer wrinkled his nose. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You have no nestrexa,
    either, from what I've heard.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I never claimed that the Tjenens are totally happy
    with me, either, I'll not lie about that. To them—well, I have to say it,
    they think me a little odd. After all, they're right—and they always are. I
    grew up with a crazy father until he died and a crazy mother, too, for much
    longer, while, at the very least, any of them have had at least eight of
    each, sometimes more, occasionally less. So I am unusual in that sense.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And brothers and sister?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Many, very many. Too many to bother indexing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Wives? Or nestas?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I alone had one only.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Where is she? You never speak of her.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane looked at the floor. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I'm afraid she died last
    Patra. Sickness.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm sorry,</q> Stringer said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Not as much as I. I miss her a great deal
    sometimes. It is difficult to be a Time Keeper; you miss your nestas when
    they have gone.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why is it that only the Time Keeper has a
    permanent family?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">A total fluke, if the story is
    correct. After the revolt—well, after the revolt there was a long period of
    which we have only infrequent records. Sometime after that, or during—so
    the story goes, mind you—Ta-tjenen decided that it needed a Time Keeper. No
    one wanted to do it, so the post was decided by the outcome of a game of
    drisbit. You may have seen it being played on occasion—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That's the game with the bones and the thread?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane nodded.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But it's totally random—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Exactly. So the winner—or loser, depending on your
    point of view—became Time Keeper. The next time around the Time Keeper was
    chosen the same way, and, by coincidence, it turned out to be the previous
    one's eldest daughter. On the third round, and I'll not tell you falsely
    here, the results were even more miraculous: the daughter's natural son was
    chosen. The Tjenens, wisely deciding that the gods were trying to tell them
    something, made the Time Keeper's position hereditary.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So you must have a child.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">A son and a daughter. I train both, as is my
    duty. They do their best to make me out a fool. One or the other of them
    will make a better Time Keeper than I.</q> Alhane chuckled at this.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Then why don't I see them?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">They are old enough—and glad enough, mind you—to be
    on their own, almost your age. You may run into them occasionally at our
    seminars. But they like their freedom for the short while they have it
    left. Soon, after I retire, one of them will take over.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Good. Then we will build the glider for the two of
    us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane sighed and nodded his head.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Patra-Bannk continued on its slow course around the sun and, almost as
    slowly, continued to rotate about its own axis. The winds calmed somewhat
    and became colder as heat radiated into space while the city of Ta-tjenen
    crawled away from the terminator into the Patra.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Tjenens' own internal time keepers continued to shift until, after less
    than a teclad, most of the population had changed sleeping sections. Now
    the effect that Stringer had noticed on a smaller scale Above was highly
    visible: he could never understand why Taljen and the others, according to
    his watch, never slept on the same schedule for many beclads. With so few
    externalities to tell them when to rise and when to sleep, the Tjenens'
    circadian cycle floated as it pleased, never remaining in phase with the
    ticking of Alhane's nonconstant clocks. Skin color, too, had radically
    altered, not just paled, but changed by many shades to a light tan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer and Alhane had just finished the last details of the sailplane
    design when the tank in the Time Keeper's room flickered and died.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Ah, Lashgar, where are you?</q> Alhane cried in the
    dark. He rose, tripped over a chair, and finally managed to find his
    tinderbox. He lit a candle and placed it inside the enclosure that guided
    its fumes to the ventilating shafts. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Gone,</q> he
    sighed over the tanks, <q ab:speaker="Alhane">and we dare not go outside to
    fix it, be the machine frozen or collapsed in the winds.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Cheer up. What did you expect for a first try? And
    so far, all the others are working. Maybe we can tie into the other
    wires—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And when the other windmills go?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We'll worry about that when the time comes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">That is not the way to
    survive on Patra-Bannk, Stringer. Remember that, because you'll have
    to.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'll remember. Now show me where you stored the
    materials.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It would be wise to take a cloak; it will be
    chilly.</q> Alhane pulled his graskhide from under the bed. Throwing it
    over his back, he set down the adjoining corridor. He carried a small
    lantern because the lights had gone out in this section. Alhane moved with
    such assurance that Stringer was certain he could have found the way even
    if blind. He navigated corners with small shuffly steps, cut across
    communal rooms, ducked under low beams that always caught Stringer's
    forehead, and climbed down precariously balanced ladders. They descended
    two levels or three, until it was dark again and cold as well. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">The oldest part of Ta-tjenen,</q> Alhane said. He
    finally opened an ancient door that was, surprisingly, made of metal,
    rusted now after belbannks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane stopped by the entrance to pick up a torch that was leaning against
    the wall and lit it with his lantern. Oily black smoke rose to the ceiling;
    Alhane coughed and quickly disappeared through the door. Stringer watched
    the flame trace the circumference of the room, leaving other torches
    flaring in its wake. Stringer began to realize how big the room was in
    which he was standing—and also what sat in the center.
  </p>

  <p>
    With his arms clasped around his chest to keep warm, Stringer walked to the
    middle of the floor. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why didn't you tell me this
    before?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And when has there been time for that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer ran his hand over the hull of a ship that looked not unlike that
    of <em>Number One</em>. The nose was more sharply pointed, the engines were
    mounted differently, and the aft flared a bit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Polkraitz?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes,</q> Alhane called out as he went from one torch
    to another, checking to make sure the fumes were being carried away by
    their ventilating hoods. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">They've been sitting here
    since the first Golun, when the Polkraitz left.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">A funny thing to leave behind.</q> Stringer
    cleared away some dust from the hull with his finger and found a
    designation. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'll be this is an ancestor of your
    own alphabet,</q> he remarked, studying the characters. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Why didn't they come back to get them? They said they
    would—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">—and this is the Golun-Patra.</q> Alhane chuckled;
    Stringer glared. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I don't know,</q> the Time Keeper
    went on. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Sometimes I wonder if the Polkraitz were
    the mighty rulers or enemies, as the Tjenens would like to believe.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So do I. The stories Taljen told me just don't
    hang together. I can't say why exactly, they just don't.</q> All this time
    Stringer had been tugging away at the hatch, which finally gave way. A
    cabin light went on as he put his foot in but faded quickly until it was
    dark once more. He grabbed a torch and brought it inside the ship. The
    controls were built for a humanoid; the labels were in a language
    resembling the Tjenen, which must have meant that the Tjenens were direct
    descendants of the Polkraitz. After a few moments of trying buttons and
    switches at random, during which time a few lights blinked and faded and a
    display screen flashed, then disappeared, it was clear that the ship was as
    dead as Stringer's own.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Now, Disillusioned Stringer, you can guess why I did
    not mention it to you for so long. We have known about these for ages.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I didn't expect much,</q> Stringer replied,
    closing the hatch behind him. He saw then, as he stepped down, that he was
    facing a wall of shelves heaped with metal and old, battered pieces of
    equipment. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The Junk?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">A good guess indeed. Left over with the ships by the
    Polkraitz. There's lots of it. We should be able to find useful parts here,
    control wire, for instance. My motto is: never throw out anything, even
    Junk. And I think there is quite enough room here to build a sailplane—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And a good place to freeze to death,</q> Stringer
    said, watching his breath emerge from his mouth in distended puffs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Would you rather build it Above?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Maybe we should. You realize you've never told me
    how cold it actually gets out there. It may be a hoax for all I know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">If you'd like to be quick-frozen, I can let you see
    for yourself. But as to how cold it gets, I should say I'm not sure. I
    never go Above myself during the Patra except at dawn, as I've
    mentioned. Indeed, to ponder it, dawn may be colder than midpatra, since by
    then it's been dark for so long that the air has had a longer time to
    clothe itself in night and cool off. But I should say again that I'm not
    sure. Once I left out a thermometer I had made during the Bannk that I
    could read from below, and it had no more sense than to crack. Then I built
    another, using a different liquid, and that coward retreated off the bottom
    of the scale, frozen solid. Then I tried another thermometer, using a
    gas. That was tricky, and my results aren't to be trusted—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What were they?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Below minus one hundred degrees centigrade. So, my
    Freezing Stringer, things aren't so bad under here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Sarek! It's positively boiling in this room! I'll
    be stripping down soon!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    And with that, Stringer got to work.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Fifteen</div>A Brief Glimpse
  Underground</h2>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I'm getting too old for this,</q> Paddelack
    grumbled as he threw down his sword and seated himself by the
    wall. Effrulyn stood leaning against the hard stone next to him, also
    watching the activity in the center of the room with a skeptical face.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">The Commander seems to be enjoying himself. Such
    trivial pastimes. The mind rots.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">And what do you do other than throw fixed
    Angles?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I?</q> Effrulyn looked down his nose at the older
    man sitting on the floor. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I am a
    mathematician. That is the reality.</q> The sound of metal against metal
    echoed off the walls.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Always imagined mathematics went out with the
    Polkraitz.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Indeed it did, for a time. More recently there
    have been a few practitioners. I have improved upon them all.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Improved upon?</q> Paddelack repeated. Pike had
    just made a good parry. He was getting better.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Yes, I've long since mastered geometry. Now I have
    succeeded in finding the area under a curve with a new method of my own
    devising.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You've invented calculus? This I have to see.</q>
    Paddelack groaned as he lumbered to his feet and followed Effrulyn out of
    the room.
  </p>

  <p>
    The giant Karrxlyn grunted as Pike stopped his blade, but he regained his
    smile when Pike was caught off guard by a knife at his chin. <q
    ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Use two hands in all things. Remember that or you
    won't live long.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike nodded, understanding the message if not all the words.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Enough of this for now. I believe it is time for
    your language lesson. Come with me, Commander.</q> The warrior set off in
    meter-plus strides, his heavy cape flowing behind him. He spun around and
    the metal of his sword flashed at Pike, but the new Commander parried it
    with a quick sideward jerk of his spear.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Good!</q> Karrxlyn bellowed with laughter and put
    his arm around Pike's shoulder. <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">But do not
    flinch. Smoothly, always smoothly. Now to your lesson.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike smiled but kept his free hand on his knife.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">So,</q> Paddelack said, <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">you really have invented calculus, as far as I can
    tell from this idiotic notation of yours. Have you done anything with your
    mathematical endeavors?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn stared at Paddelack in disbelief. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Done
    anything with it? Mathematics is for itself. But…</q> he paused, looking
    downward, <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I am afraid my objectivity compels me to
    confess to one impure act.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack's eyes gleamed and he grinned his toothy grin. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">And what might that be? If, of course, you aren't
    afraid to talk about it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">It's cold in here.</q> Effrulyn lit the fire in
    the room and shut the door. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">You understand that no
    one is aware of my involvement in this. If word gets around, I will end up
    doing nothing but impure applications. So silence is requested.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Absolutely.</q> Paddelack nodded eagerly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I was recently approached by one of the others,
    and he complained to me of the difficulty in keeping time. The clocks were
    so bad that the Checkers had just missed sunrise by more than a beclad. I
    told him that I was not interested in things of such nature—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Of course.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Yes.</q> Effrulyn glanced down at the one or two
    pieces of paper on his desk. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Then he told me he
    had noticed that a swinging weight seemed to swing with a constant
    period. He wondered if that fact could be used to build a better clock
    mechanism, but he had no way of knowing for sure. I am certain that he
    never had another idea in his life. He does very little other than build
    bad clocks. He asked me if I could demonstrate that the swing of a weight
    was truly constant. After incessant whining on his part, he finally
    persuaded me. I showed that it was approximately so. It was a fairly simple
    matter; I didn't even need my new mathematics. And you see the result: that
    monster in the great hall. Always clacking away—click, clack, click,
    clack—and disturbing my thoughts. A fitting reward for my labors. And what
    good is it? It may keep good time, but as all the other clocks were off to
    begin with, the fool had no way to set this one. After all, we had missed
    sunset. But everyone is very taken with it, even though it may be
    wrong. Not only that, the idiots don't seem to realize that even if it is
    the most accurate clock we have, there is no way of checking its
    accuracy. And they tell me it is the greatest advance in timekeeping since
    they decided to keep the teclad constant and vary the number of teclads in
    the Patra, instead of keeping the Patra a constant number of teclads and
    changing the length of the unit.</q> Effrulyn sat down at his desk and
    waved Paddelack away. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I ask you, what difference
    can it possibly make when the idiots have no idea of what they are doing in
    the first place? Toys, that's all that clocks are, toys. Let them play with
    their toys. Who cares what time it is when there is work to be done?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack quietly left the room and shut the door behind him. He heard the
    bolt slide firm on the other side and tried hard not to break out into
    gales of laughter. He then realized he was probably late for Pike's
    language lesson, even though, of course, there was no way of telling.
  </p>

  <p>
    The huge clock on the dais of the great hall did indeed clack away as its
    long pendulum swung slowly back and forth. Every so often the clock next to
    it would buzz loudly and the short timepiece would add its voice to the
    general cacophony. But the noise did not disturb Paddelack as it did
    Effrulyn, no more than it did the two guards who stood on either side of
    the timepieces. Paddelack sat down with the old Fara-Ny and Karrxlyn. They
    had already begun the lesson, and Pike seemed to be stuck on a point.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Good, I see you have arrived. Tell our respected hosts
    that I would be interested in having the secret of the Fairtalian explained
    to me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    After Paddelack had made the translation, Fara-Ny replied, <q
    ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">Of course, Commander. Karrxlyn, show him how to open
    the pendant.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn did so, and Pike studied the compass, maps, and list of cardinal
    numbers inside. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I am afraid you will have to explain
    this to me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">Certainly,</q> replied Fara-Ny through
    Paddelack. <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">When you have learned to read better,
    you will see that you have directions to the nearest stala. The stala is
    the method we use to travel, which you were so curious about. I am afraid I
    cannot explain how it works other than to say that it does. One enters the
    stala and emerges—Elsewhere.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Elsewhere?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">I have difficulty in describing even that. Where
    the Elsewheres are located is a matter of speculation, although we have
    identified a handful of them, notably Triesk, with the help of the old
    map. But as to most, be they north, south—or elsewhere, who can say?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">How long have you known about them?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">Some for belbannks, some only recently. More and
    more Elsewheres seem to become accessible to us as the Bannk's heat trails
    into memory. At most Elsewheres, however, the Fear is present, or an overly
    hostile environment, so we have severely limited our travel. It is odd,
    though, that most of the Elsewheres have been discovered since the visit of
    the earlier Polkraitz, Hendig. Suddenly many Elsewheres were available to
    us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Hendig?</q> Paddelack exclaimed. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">How did you know him?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">We heard of him from the Liddlefurans. I have been
    told you were a companion of his.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack nodded. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Yes, I came with him.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Interesting,</q> Pike said. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'd
    like to see this so-called stala.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">I am afraid that is impossible,</q> Fara-Ny
    replied, with a wheezing sigh. <q ab:speaker="Pike">The Patra is now too
    deep and the walk is too long. You will have to wait for the Bannk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">It seems that I will.</q> Pike pulled his cloak around
    him and stared at the flickering torches. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well,</q> he
    said abruptly, <q ab:speaker="Pike">let's get on with the lesson!</q> He
    slammed his fist on the table and looked around, smiling.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Sixteen</div>The First Crack in
  the Sky</h2>

  <p>
    Stringer tossed and turned in his bed, finally giving up any hope of
    sleep. Wouldn't those neighbors ever shut up? Even though everyone in this
    section of Ta-tjenen currently had approximately the same sleeping time,
    Stringer, after some teclads, was still out of phase simply because his
    circadian rhythm, floating or not, was not that of a Tjenen, and his
    waking-sleeping cycle would probably never converge fully to theirs. So the
    neighbors went on talking regardless of Stringer. He began to doubt that
    the heat had anything to do with Ta-tjenen's silence during the Bannk and
    became convinced that the real reason was because it was so noisy during
    the Patra. There was little to do but go to school and socialize, and by
    dawn everyone was sick of one another until the next time around. A very
    convenient system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer climbed out of bed and found some clothes to put on, then walked
    into the corridor whose light tanks had been replaced by ventilated
    torches. No mistakes allowed during the Patra. Stringer was feeling
    nervous. He admitted to himself that he was feeling more and more that way
    as the Patra wore on. The walls of Ta-tjenen were very close. Alhane also
    paced more and more; the rest of Ta-tjenen seemed as usual, no one the
    least bit claustrophobic. Perhaps a nestrexa was a good thing for that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer made a quick stop at one of the communal toilets from which waste
    would be taken and burned for added heat. He strode down the corridor,
    climbed down a ladder, then entered a room that was carved out of solid
    rock. He opened a faucet that was at the bottom of a huge metal tank and
    gulped down a cup of water. The top of the reservoir was open, above the
    street, and full of snow. The bottom was here, above a fire to melt the ice
    and produce drinking water. Stringer turned to the nearby door.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was his shift in one of the heating rooms. His Alien status did not
    deprive him of that. Besides, he didn't mind the work; it was the only
    exercise he got, and lately his body had been feeling as if it were rotting
    from the bones up. He glanced at the pipes that entered from the ceiling;
    frost covered most of their lengths and water vapor fumed into the warmer
    surroundings. The upper ends of the pipes, like the reservoirs, could be
    seen projecting above the ground along the streets of the city, taller than
    a house to be certain they rose above the snow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer took off his shirt, shivered a moment, and followed the air ducts
    into the next room. He walked over to a huge pile of wood and began heaving
    pieces into the furnace. He saw the sparkling white frost on the pipes lose
    its color and turn to dribbling water as the tubes made their circuits
    around the heat exchanger to exit into the living quarters above.
  </p>

  <p>
    For perhaps two telclads Stringer fed the fire until he had tired himself
    sufficiently to relax. He threw down the last log, breathed deeply, and
    left the room. He dragged himself up the stairs, passed a classroom and
    heard a snatch of a lesson on the evils of the Polkraitz, sighed, and
    wandered on to the nearest communal room.
  </p>

  <p>
    As always, it was filled with people, talking, running, eating,
    singing. Such a contrast to the Ta-tjenen of the Bannk, when all the time
    had been spent preparing for the Patra. Then there had been silence as
    people went about their business. Now there was noise. In the Bannk, the
    meeting tent was the only place of association. Now dozens of communal
    rooms were filled constantly. Was the Patra the time of fear? Or was it a
    vacation for Ta-tjenen? Stringer was not sure he understood; rather, he was
    certain that he did not yet understand the cycle of the Tjenen mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    If anyone took notice of Stringer as he walked in, Stringer himself was not
    aware of it. He was a grudgingly accepted figure now—and one that was
    ignored if at all possible. No one bothered to speak to him now. That is,
    no one but Taljen.
  </p>

  <p>
    She walked up to Stringer as if they were the closest of cousins, even
    though they had not spoken to each other for three teclads. At first he did
    not recognize her; her skin was so fair now, and even her hair had changed
    color. She could be a fairy-tale princess now, Stringer thought.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Play your rodoft for us, Stringer, so we can
    dance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I have work to do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Then you would not be here now. Play your rodoft for
    us. Your work can wait.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You don't want to hear me. I'm terrible.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I've heard you play when I've passed your
    rooms. Your melodies are simple, yes, and you do not use all the notes, but
    in your own way you are better than our best. You have always learned
    quickly, Silent Stringer, learned everything quickly, except that there is
    no good in playing the rodoft if no one ever heard you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">All right. Wait while I get it.</q> Stringer left
    and returned shortly with his rodoft. He sat down on a cushion near the
    door and began tuning the instrument whose sounds had slowly, painfully,
    become one with his ears in the last teclads. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So
    you say I don't use all the notes, do you? We'll see about that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    He picked up the bow, smoothed down the hairs, and placed his fingers on
    the gut. He started slowly, remembering a tune he had heard at the Festival
    long ago. Did it go like this? Or did it go like this? No matter, he'd
    invent his own variation. The bow bit and the dancers started in slow
    rhythm. Rhythm. Strong, good for dancing. Not too fast now for the calm
    Tjenen heartbeat. A little more now. Stringer's fingers began plucking,
    faster and faster. The dancers whirled in endless patterns. Stringer's bow
    became a blur, interrupted only when his fingertips took over the work,
    faster still. The dancers raised their feet, kicking and stamping. The
    floor trembled. Faster. Sweat broke out on Stringer's brow. The floor
    rumbled, and again. Stringer's head nodded in tight, quick jerks in time
    with his music. Faster yet. You are playing as you have never played
    before. <em>Crack!</em> The sound echoed around his ears. Stringer glanced
    at his bow, then jerked his eyes to the ceiling. Cold vapor, leaving a
    visible trail behind it, was falling lazily to the floor.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Everybody out!</q> he screamed. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Get out of this room!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    He couldn't remember what happened next. Another rumble. People running,
    lots of noise, screaming. He dove for the door next to him, tumbling out
    the exit, rolling over with his rodoft. He shook his head clear just as he
    heard an immense crash behind him. He was up in an instant and putting his
    full weight on the door. Supercooled air curled under the door, reaching
    his sandal. A sharp, stinging sensation on his toe and the pain was gone.
  </p>

  <p>
    People filled the corridor. He quickly took off his shirt and jammed it
    underneath the door. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Get out of the corridor!</q>
    he shouted. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Seal it off!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Tjenens obeyed quickly. His was the only voice of Command, and they
    listened. Was it as easy as that? Stringer wondered.
  </p>

  <p>
    As he pushed his way through the crowd back to his room, he met Alhane
    running in the opposite direction. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What happened,
    Stringer? Tell me what happened.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It was an earthquake. The roof caved in.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">An earthquake? What is that? I have never heard of
    such a thing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'll explain later. What can be done? I…I locked
    those people in there. I didn't know how cold…if they could have
    survived…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Time Keeper tugged on Stringer's arm. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Come on,
    stop that. There was so little hope. You did the only thing you could. Now
    let's get the quazzats.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was soon dressed in the heaviest garments he had ever seen. Thick
    boots with many socks, graskhide sweaters loose with air pockets, and a
    thick parka with a long hooded snout lined with fur.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I've never gone out in midpatra,</q> Alhane said in
    a muffled voice as they finished dressing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer froze. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Are you crazy? We're going out in
    these things and you don't even know what is going to happen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I told you, no one ever goes out in the Patra—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer began getting undressed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">—but I have gone out at dawn on many occasion. And,
    as I've mentioned before, I suspect that it is as cold then as
    now. Besides, I've read the instructions my father left.…Now, Stringer, let
    us get on with it. Just remember to keep moving and breathe through your
    nose. The long hood will trap enough warm air to keep you from freezing
    your lungs.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">My hands, what about my hands?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I'll give you some chemical heating pads if you
    want. But you shouldn't need them if you keep moving.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer winced as he put on the thick mittens. He hoped that Alhane's
    extrapolations from the dawn and the ancient instructions were not as
    mythical as the Polkraitz seemed to be.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first thing that Stringer saw as they entered the communal room was a
    huge gap in the roof and a great pile of debris. An arm jutted out there, a
    leg here, quick-frozen in the cold of the Patra. Negative one hundred
    degrees centigrade. Could it really be that cold? Had there been any hope?
    Had he acted too quickly? If not, then perhaps the Patra was more gentle
    than the Bannk in that respect: the Bannk killed you a little at the time,
    broiled you alive, but only if you were careless and stayed out too
    long. Here, in the Patra, there might not be any hope at all, but at least
    death was quick, essentially instantaneous. Or was it? Stringer gnawed at
    his lip, doubting everything all at once.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly something occurred to Stringer and he began circling the room
    slowly, pulling out the wires to the lighting tanks.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What are you doing?</q> he heard Alhane cry out.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Look.</q> He pointed up.
  </p>

  <p>
    For perhaps the first time in his life, the Time Keeper saw stars, real
    stars. Not the one or two or even three or four bright ones to be seen at
    dawn, but stars heaped one upon another, splattered across the sky, densely
    thick, in this late stage of the universe, as all galaxies had begun to
    merge. There were more stars than night here at Ta-tjenen, the Center.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Alhane…Time Keeper.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane didn't budge. Stringer let him be and went to work clearing out the
    bodies before the cold penetrated the skin.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    After the last of the bodies had been dragged away, now conveniently
    preserved for their future use as food, Stringer emerged into the corridor
    and pulled down his hood. Repair would take some time now, but at this
    moment he needed to rest. Tjenens were walking about, unconcerned since the
    danger had passed, as if they had already forgotten those who had been
    killed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen!
  </p>

  <p>
    The thought hit him between the eyes. Where was she? He had not seen her
    since the collapse, nor had he found her body. Was she alive? Stringer
    began running down the hall as fast as he could, but halted suddenly when
    he realized that he didn't even know where her quarters were located. There
    were twenty thousand people crammed into underground Ta-tjenen, stacked on
    top of one another, wedged into every nook and cranny. Where could she be?
    But then again, everybody in Ta-tjenen knew everybody else. Stringer
    stopped the first person he saw.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was no mistaking the glare in Benjfold's eyes when he recognized the
    Alien in the heavy parka. <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">What do you want,
    Returned? Did you cause this, too?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer ignored the last remark. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Taljen, have you
    seen her?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Benjfold looked back at Stringer with keen amusement. <q
    ab:speaker="Benjfold">I have a new nesta for this cycle, this Parlztlu; why
    would I know where Taljen is?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Were wives so easily forgotten here? Stringer let him go and wandered
    on. The corridors were jammed with people who had come to find out whose
    <q>husbands</q> had died and whose nestas' sister and brothers and
    grandfathers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The head of the nestrexam, the head of families, Kenken Wer, Who Stands at
    the Center, passed Stringer. He looked the other way and did not see her
    spit at his feet. After several attempts he learned that Taljen's room was
    on the other side of Ta-tjenen, in another sleeping zone, so it took almost
    a telclad to reach, and his trail was littered with the pieces of heavy
    clothing he discarded as he hurried in quick lengthy strides.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her door was open, rather, there was no door to be shut, and she was
    sitting on her mat, unmoving and quiet. Stringer sat down beside her and
    she began talking to herself, hardly noticing his presence.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">…all of them. My child, Uslid, my first nesta…they
    were all killed.…</q> Then she looked up at Stringer and studied his dirty
    face for a long while, eyes blue and intense. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You,
    Alien Stringer, are the only one left.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer held her. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Will you go south with me? When
    the Bannk begins?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen looked up, half smiling, half sighing. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">There
    seems to be little reason for me to stay, does there?</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Stringer jogged through the corridors because he couldn't bear to walk any
    longer, just as he could hardly bear to sit down for more than a few
    belclads at a time before he got itchy. No one else ever jogged. All sat or
    worked in the maddeningly calm Tjenen way. This made Stringer even more
    nervous. His footfalls thumped to a halt outside the Time Keeper's room. He
    had not seen Alhane since the collapse and he now needed his help.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane was in his room—where else could he be?—still quazzated in his parka
    as if Stringer hadn't left him at all a beclad earlier. He sat at his desk
    with his hands on his head, running his fingers through his hair.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What happened?</q> Stringer asked. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">You obviously didn't freeze to death.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No, but your watch did, I thank it.</q> Alhane threw
    the useless timepiece on the table.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you need it for,
    anyway?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">This last beclad I discovered that the stars move. I
    wanted to clock them with your watch, but it died, so now I can't.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The chair, as usual, was wedged between bed and desk, and Stringer had to
    struggle to sit down. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why not?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane pointed into his auxiliary room. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You've seen
    those clocks; how many read the same thing?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    It was true. Now about halfway through the Patra, all the clocks said
    something different, sometimes off from one another by half a beclad. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">I thought you were calibrating them against my
    watch.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">As well as I could, not having fully deduced the
    correspondence between your watch and my clocks.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So now what's the problem? Why can't you use your
    clocks?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Now your watch is dead. Now if I clock the stars, I
    get different answers depending on which clock I use. I ask you, is that a
    good state of the world?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why don't you take one reading with one clock and
    then another with the same?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And when the interval differ in each trial?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Surely your clock is wrong, then.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Surely? Is it the first or second or third reading
    that is wrong—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Your clocks must be good enough to be close on
    successive readings—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">—or is it the stars that are moving
    nonconstantly?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Certainly the stars move as constantly as my
    watch.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">An assumption of faith, I thank you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No greater faith than assuming the same for my
    watch.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes, Young Stringer, it is too bad that we have to
    assume anything. Why should I assume the stars move constantly? The sun
    doesn't climb at a constant rate. It hovers around Mid-Bannk and drops
    quickly toward the Patra. Is that constant?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But surely the only reason the sun seems to move
    like that is because we're standing on the ground. The sun moves
    constantly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It does? I am not convinced. What I need is a
    reliably constant unit: your dead watch.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I thought your units were nonconstant.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Then I need a constant unit to know that my
    nonconstant units are changing correctly—if not constantly. Besides, as I
    once explained to you, it is only the telclads on up that are
    nonconstant. So we are back to the same discussion.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, I suppose we are.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Don't you see my dilemma? To keep my clocks
    constant, I need a constant unit of time. If you are right and the stars,
    in some way yet to be deduced, move constantly, then I could use the time
    it takes for the stars to move such and such a distance. But in order to
    know how long it takes a star to move such and such a distance, I need a
    good clock—a constant unit of time.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Can't you just say that it takes a certain amount
    of time for a star to move a degree, since we've decided to put our faith
    in its constancy?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">We have? But suppose it is wrong?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you mean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What if I say it take a third of a given beclad for
    a star to move a degree, but it really doesn't. Then what?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer stood up and waved his arms. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, I
    don't know. How do you check your clocks in the Bannk?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">The sun, of course. If I catch sunrise, I set the
    clocks then—that is, if I can decided exactly when sunrise is. Doing so
    takes so long. The problem is lack of sunrises. The time between sunset and
    sunrise is so long that all the clocks are off in between. I wish they came
    every beclad. How easy things would be then!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">If you had a star that was in a certain position
    at Mid-Patra, then you could set your clocks by it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">How would I know when Mid-Patra was?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">By your clocks?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You see the problem.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer sighed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I see that you've totally
    confused me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">The only thing to do is to take my best clock—which
    is none too good—and start recording. Maybe after several Patras and some
    good guessing, I will know the answer.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Taljen and Stringer faced each other across the table in the refectory,
    each munching the fibrous root that was a good deal of their diet.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">If it weren't for you,</q> said Stringer, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">no one would talk to me at all. I play my rodoft and
    people listen. No one says anything to me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Do you say anything to anyone?</q> Stringer was
    pondering how to answer that, but Taljen continued. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">How long was it that we did not speak to each
    other?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">About three teclads.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I hadn't realized.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And what were you doing all that time?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Mostly working in the kitchen. Teaching a few
    classes. And yourself?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The glider.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You haven't shown it to me yet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, I guess I haven't.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Anything else?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Playing my rodoft. There isn't much else to
    do. Sometimes I want to break down the walls here.</q> Stringer stared at
    up at the low ceiling, which was supported at frequent intervals by
    pod-tree trunks; his glance followed the network of ventilator shafts that
    skewed this way and that across the ceiling or rose vertically from the
    floor.
  </p>

  <p>
    At that moment Alhane, in a state of great agitation, burst into the room,
    collided with Kenken Wer, whose food went flying over the floor and under
    tables, tripped over two benches, and stumbled to his feet in front of
    Taljen and Stringer while Kenken Wer's fierce gaze penetrated the back of
    his head.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I have found it! Stringer, I have found it! A bright
    star that moves faster than the others. Could it be another planet moving
    around Patra-Bannk, as you thought? Perhaps it is the one we need to check
    your gravity.</q> The Time Keeper grabbed a piece of cold meat as the room
    filled with noisy puzzlement and more Tjenens entered to find out what was
    going on. They did not have much of a chance because Alhane ran out
    immediately, colliding with Kenken Wer once more, scattering her carefully
    re-collected food to the four corners a second time. The noise level
    subsided for a moment but soon rose again to its initial height.
  </p>

  <p>
    A Tjenen—a total stranger to Stringer—stopped by his table and leaned close
    to his ear. <q ab:speaker="a Tjenen">What have you done to him, Alien?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer didn't respond. He looked straight ahead and kept chewing his
    food.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the remark caused Taljen to reflect silently as she herself stared
    downward, fiddling with the food on her dish and not meeting Stringer's
    eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What did I do now?</q> Stringer finally asked when
    the lapse in conversation became too long to ignore.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen shook her head, still not looking up. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Nothing,</q> she said softly, even gently. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer, tell me, do stars exist?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you mean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Alhane's flecks of light. Do they exist? Or are they
    illusion?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You haven't looked?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Alhane had asked me to, but I am afraid to go Above,
    especially after what happened.…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, yes, stars exist,</q> Stringer chuckled.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What are they? Balls of ice, as Alhane thought?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, suns like your own but very far away, so they
    look like points of ice to the eye. My own sun is one of them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">How far away?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Very far away. Too far for anyone to conceive,
    really. Farther away than the horizon, farther than Glintz or Godrhan,
    farther away than the Edge of the World.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen nodded. After another long silence she asked: <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">And how do they burn? Are they made of wood? Of tree
    resin?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer laughed again. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, they burn by nuclear
    reactions.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">And, Stringer, what is a nuclear reaction?</q> she
    asked, slowly articulating her new word.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It is…it is…it is a word that people use for
    stars, that's all.</q> Taljen did not reply, and the conversation lapsed
    again. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Have I said something wrong?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    This time Taljen laughed, her great flexible laugh that spanned four
    octaves. She shook her head.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer gazed off for a moment with glassy eyes. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">You know, Alhane should watch out; people have been
    burned for less.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen cocked her head. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What do you mean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I mean that people don't like sacred doctrines to
    be contradicted.</q> Stringer then raised his earthen mug to eye level,
    stared at it momentarily, and said, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, to those
    who burn.…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You are bitter,</q> Taljen said. She laughed
    softly. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">And you forget that to contradict a doctrine
    presupposes one already exists. But as stars were just discovered, their
    reality still largely unknown, I don't see how any belief could have been
    attached to them.</q> Taljen grinned. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Perhaps,
    Stringer, Kenken Wer will concoct one just to contradict Alhane's findings,
    but I shouldn't worry about that too much. More likely, he will be allowed
    to study his flecks of light, allowed to play his games. No one will care,
    even if they do eventually believe that stars exist. After all, as Time
    Keeper, Alhane has been useful with his other discoveries. Unless this new
    game interferes with his old work, no one will mind his playing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why do you call it a game?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It is hard to conceive, Stringer, don't you think,
    what could come of this. Even if he does discover your gravity, what
    difference will it make to us here at Ta-tjenen? He will be able to write
    down an equation to tell us how gravity works, but it will be the same
    gravity which pulls us to the ground nonetheless.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes.</q> Stringer nodded and said very slowly, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I suppose it is hard to conceive.</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Seventeen</div>Fire or Stars;
  Personalities vs. Universes</h2>

  <p>
    Pike awoke coughing and wheezing in a smoke-filled room. He quickly ran
    over to Paddelack's bed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Get up! Paddelack, get up!</q> Paddelack stirred
    slowly at first, rubbed his eyes, and then jumped up as Pike had. He
    quickly put on some shoes while Pike knelt to awaken the girl who had been
    sleeping beside him. They threw on their robes as fast as possible and
    bolted from the room.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gostum were already running by in neat, orderly files. <q ab:speaker="young
    Fairtalian">Commander, come this way!</q> Pike was pulled through corridors
    thick with smoke. His eyes were stinging, and he was coughing so much that
    he thought he would rip out his lungs. The girl collapsed beside him and he
    halted. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Take her!</q> he ordered, and she was carried
    away.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abruptly, he was shoved into a rock-walled chamber and heavy blankets were
    thrust into his hands, as well as a heavy parka. <q ab:speaker="young
    Fairtalian">Hopefully you will be safe here, Commander,</q> said the young
    Fairtalian as he disappeared and shut the door behind him. Just then a
    blast of cold air hit Pike's face. He looked about him: the room was
    crowded with people huddling together. He saw the glare of a fire that must
    have been burning around the corner and rushed over to it. Three fires
    occupied a ledge of windows that undoubtedly led almost directly to the
    outside world. Pike stood there for many moments, turning frantically this
    way and that. The walls began to close in on him. The fires on the ledge
    began to envelop the entire room in flames. He would throw himself on the
    logs and immolate himself. But no. Pike was keenly aware of the quiet
    discipline of the Gostum, the iron-willing discipline that characterized
    their every action. He hadn't shouted, had he? That was not a good thing to
    do, not here. Absolutely not. Pike took a deep breath, walked calmly to the
    door, and left the chamber.
  </p>

  <p>
    The corridors were still thick with smoke and cold with the little fresh
    air that was being allowed in. Pike was sure that Konndjlan would soon die,
    but now was as good a time as any. He put his robe in front of his mouth
    and continued walking. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Karrxlyn, is that you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The giant rushed over to him. <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Commander, you
    should be in the emergency chamber.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike ignored him. <q ab:speaker="Pike">What is wrong?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">One of the exhaust shafts in the furnace room
    broke. Several of them, perhaps. It was an unforgivable mistake and we will
    all pay dearly for it. We are already letting in too much fresh air. You
    see, my feet are already numb. We do not have quazzats enough for more than
    a handful, so no one can go out. But I must go down again and see what can
    be done.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You may die.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">One may always die. That is what life is all
    about.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'm coming with you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">But, Commander—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Does a Commander huddle with the children? As you say,
    one may always die. That is how Gostum survive, isn't it? That is how we
    survive.</q> They went below.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike doused himself with water on the way down and coughed through wet
    cloth. When he entered the furnace room, he could see the flames shooting
    out from the furnace itself. The stockpile of wood had caught on fire and
    the whole room seemed aflame. The exhaust shafts, which normally took the
    deadly fumes to the surface, were themselves on fire and now useless. One
    of the hollow wooden pipes had collapsed and Pike could see the body of an
    unfortunate Gostum beneath it. Well, he would have paid with his life,
    anyway.…
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Use the drinking water!</q> Pike shouted as he began
    dragging the nearest of the kindling from the room.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">But that is reserved!</q> Karrxlyn shouted back.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">There is nothing else! We'll melt snow and get
    more. Use it!</q> Pike coughed and left the room only long enough to get a
    drink and a bit more oxygen. Buckets were being brought now, but that
    method clearly was useless. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Karrxlyn! Can you block
    all the ventilators and exhaust ducts to this room? All of them?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">How will we breathe?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">We're not breathing now. Can you do it? Fires can't
    burn without air. Cut it off!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">I will see what can be done.</q> Karrxlyn shook
    his head. The ventilators all passed close to the furnaces to heat the
    incoming air, and the fresh air for Konndjlan came through this room and
    the few others like it. But with the ventilators in flames the air was no
    longer fresh. Perhaps from the floor above they could be blocked. He
    grabbed three of the nearest men with axes and disappeared.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike removed as much of the fuel store and burning logs as he could and
    sealed the furnace-room door shut behind him, shoving his cape
    underneath. Karrxlyn returned shortly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">We have done what you commanded. All the incoming
    shafts are blocked from above, and water is being poured down them as
    well.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Good.</q> Pike coughed heavily and ran upstairs. Now
    they would wait. Upstairs, the air was getting colder from the fresh,
    unheated air being admitted simply to keep the Gostum alive. Pike found a
    draft, huddled in his robes, and leaned against the wall. He grabbed the
    familiar gaunt figure as it walked by aimlessly. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Paddelack,</q> he said, <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">you once mentioned that you saw a steam engine in
    the shop downstairs.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack rubbed his bird-beaked nose and his eyes, then nodded.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Do you think you can do something with it? Convert it
    into a heating system? Something?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I'll see what I can do,</q> Paddelack wheezed.
  </p>

  <p>
    After an hour or so, Pike heard from Karrxlyn that fifty had died from
    smoke poisoning. All around him, Pike could see people sick from near
    asphyxiation or exposure to cold air. The sound of coughing and sneezing,
    usually incidental to Pike, now became utterly unbearable to him. He knew
    that it would go on for weeks. The air would remain foul, hardly
    breathable. The rugs and furniture would smell of smoke. Konndjlan would be
    barely habitable. More people would die from the aftereffects of that one
    mistake. It wasn't over. But Pike no longer had any doubt in his mind about
    why the Gostum wanted to leave Patra-Bannk.

  <p>
    Not long after the fire, as Paddelack was on his way to test his first
    improved steam engine, he found Effrulyn coughing through the
    halls. Activity had returned to normal, and only the tang in the air and
    the unusual cold remained as annoyances.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Where are you going so fast?</q> Paddelack asked,
    catching Effrulyn by the arm.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">To work,</q> he answered, spinning around and
    jerking away.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Nowhere else? Nothing more important to do?</q>
    Paddelack said that just to annoy the mathematician and was glad to see
    that it had the desired effect.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">What could be more important?</q> Effrulyn
    replied, raising his voice and an eyebrow.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What I wanted to ask you: what do you know about
    the stala?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">No more or less than anyone else.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Ever use it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Of course not. Why should I bother with such a
    waste of time? But I have heard stories about it. Well do I remember one
    event.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What was that?</q> Paddelack pressed, sitting
    down in the nearest archway.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn looked off nostalgically into the distance and raised an arm. <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">There I was, sitting peacefully in thought, in the
    great hall where that monstrous clock of my own devising now stands. This
    was well before the time of the clock, you understand—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I understand.</q> Paddelack nodded.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">In comes running a guard who had just come from an
    Elsewhere, evidently a new Elsewhere, and ridden up from the
    stala. <q>Fara-Ny, call the astronomers,</q> he ordered—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Hold it. Tell me about the astronomers. Didn't
    think there were any around here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Madmen all. I'm not exactly sure when the first
    star was discovered, but it must have been a long time ago, probably during
    an emergency when someone was forced to go outside. From what I am told,
    the stars were a rage that first Patra and everybody went out—if only for a
    few clads—just to see what they looked like. Some started observation, but
    the next Patra nothing was the same. Almost all new stars. Why they
    expected them to be the same, only a metaphysician could tell you. So the
    astronomers got scared. Not only that, but several died from freezing. By
    this time they had decided that stars would only get them killed, and the
    fools had enough sense to get out of the cold. So astronomy has only had
    intermittent followers. Always they reach the conclusion that stars aren't
    good for anything—I could have told them that—and give up after a few
    teclads.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">So what do they do?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Mostly they are old men, too old to fight or to
    think, who sit around and make mindless speculations. They once asked me to
    join them, and I said I don't frame hypotheses. Anyway, where was I?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">The stala.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn" class="no-close-quote">Ah, yes. The guard, who had
    so rudely disturbed the silence, explained agitatedly that when he and his
    party emerged at the Elsewhere, they had immediately noticed that the sun
    had moved. It was in the wrong place.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn" class="no-close-quote">The astronomers went into a
    great debate about this. I suspect that the problem had often been debated
    before. The Ex-tal school, the oldest of the old men, had long been
    convinced that the Elsewheres were not on Patra-Bannk at all, and this
    discovery went to prove it for them. The Al-tal school decided that the sun
    had moved of its own free will, but they were contradicted by the In-tal
    school, who had always claimed that the sun was just condensed vapor and
    couldn't do what it pleased. The In-tals wanted to know why, if the sun had
    moved at an Elsewhere, it hadn't moved here. This was heresy to the
    Al-tals, who answered that the sun had moved where it wanted simply
    because, at an Elsewhere, the sun could do whatever it pleased. Then the
    Ex-tal school jumped up again, saying that, of course, the answer was that
    the Elsewhere was completely off Patra-Bannk and that the sun was being
    viewed from a forbidden position and that travels to the Elsewheres must
    cease immediately. Then one of the In-tals had the temerity to suggest that
    maybe it wasn't even the sun that was being observed, but a duplicate
    traveling on the other side of heaven. This he conjectured as a compromise
    to the Ex-tals, who insisted that the Elsewheres were elsewhere. But the
    rest of the In-tals wouldn't have anything to do with this doctrine. The
    argument went on mindlessly for a long time.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn" class="no-close-quote">At the end, even though I
    was very young, someone asked me what I thought. I asked the guard whether
    he had gone north or south or east or west, but naturally the fool could
    only say elsewhere. <q>Which way was the sun displaced?</q> I asked
    him. <q>To the east,</q> he replied. Well, the answer was then clear to
    me. I said the world was bent in the east-west direction.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">You should have seen the uproar!</q> Effrulyn
    laughed heartily. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn"><q>That is a dangerous thing to
    say,</q> one of them told me. <q>You idiots!</q> I said to them. <q>What do
    I care whether the world is flat or bent? That's for you quibblers to worry
    about. Does it make any difference to your lives? Of course it doesn't. It
    makes no difference whatsoever. You're just obscurantists, that's all. I
    say the world is shaped like a doughnut.</q> They didn't understand the
    joke, of course, and I have been censured ever since.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    At first Paddelack was amused by the intensity of the diatribe, but then he
    began to realize that, perhaps, Effrulyn not only didn't care about the
    shape of the world but also didn't know. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What do
    you believe?</q> Paddelack asked seriously.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Believe? I don't even think about it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Why not?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Don't you understand?</q> Effrulyn scowled. <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">It becomes clearer to me all the time that reality is
    simply what people want to believe is real. No more, no less. Therefore, I
    content myself with obviously unreal things in order not to fall prey to
    those illusions that seem to occupy everyone else around here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Hmm,</q> Paddelack murmured. He conceded that
    Effrulyn might have a point; certainly some people he knew seemed to create
    their own realities. But he still wanted to know something more about the
    stala, and suddenly it occurred to him that however the thing operated, it
    took people far enough so that a displacement of the sun was noticeable,
    even obvious. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Do you have idea how far the stala
    goes?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">For all I know, it goes nowhere and these people
    are deluding themselves.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Do you have any idea how big this planet is?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">At least as far as the horizon, if I'm to be
    forced into metaphysical speculations.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">And how far is that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Too far to walk. As far away as the sun.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What do you mean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn's wild gesticulations showed that he was on the verge of
    leaving. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">What do you think I mean? The sun sinks
    at the horizon, so that's how far away it is.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Seems to me,</q> Paddelack said as he creaked up
    from his sitting position, <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">that if the world's
    bent, it might be bigger than that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">All illusions!</q> Effrulyn cried, and both he and
    Paddelack walked away in opposite directions.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Eighteen</div>Confronting the
  Past, Confronting the Present, Confronting the Future</h2>

  <p>
    Perhaps a teclad after the discovery of the other planet, Stringer found
    Alhane, as usual, at his cluttered desk.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It's no use,</q> the Time Keeper said as Stringer
    walked in after a long shift on his sailplane.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What's no use?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You say that I must observe the planets and chart
    their courses to figure out gravity. How can I chart the course of a planet
    if the sky changes so slowly? My star has disappeared, and who knows how
    long it will be before it returns—if it ever does?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was still sweating from his run up from the old storeroom and was
    anxious to return there, but he sat down, anyway. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Alhane, Time Keeper, I see that you want to do
    everything yourself, discover the whole Universe. But that is too much for
    any one man, even you. At the rate that Patra-Bannk moves—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Patra-Bannk doesn't move!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">At the rate the stars move, I'm sure that it would
    take you many Patras to piece together the entire sky, if you could do it
    at all. That, Time Keeper Who Is Impatient, is a life's work for any
    man.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Then what can be done?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Either you make that your life's work or you use
    the work of another.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Who?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You come from a long line of Time Keepers. I
    realize that the Patras are deep and no one goes out except in an
    emergency, but I find it hard to believe that you are the first to observe
    stars. Man's curiosity is deeper than the Patra. Didn't a Time Keeper of
    the past leave anything?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane started, sighed deeply, and nodded. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You're
    right. My father must have. I just realized.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you mean, you just realized?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">My father died after I had nine Bannks and ten
    Patras. I was there. The last thing he said to me was, <q>I hope you can
    understand the stars.</q></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And just now you get around to it?</q> Stringer
    cried.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane laughed slowly. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I didn't remember it until
    now.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer scowled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't believe you could forget
    a thing like that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">First of all, I didn't understand what he was
    talking about—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Still, with your curiosity—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You don't understand, Stringer. I think I hated my
    father. I must have intentionally ignored the advice for Patra-Bannks until
    I truly did forget about it. I am sure you have done the same at times.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Perhaps. But hated your father? Then how did you
    become a Time Keeper at all?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It isn't a matter of choice. I was brought up to
    it. By the time I had eleven Bannks and ten Patras, or maybe a little
    older, when I was old enough to choose, it was too late. I hated my parents
    for it—that is, until I discovered how to love the work for itself and
    divorce it from my mother and father. Some prospective Time Keepers do that
    and end up like me—for better or for worse. Others don't, like my younger
    brother, and don't become Time Keepers.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You know, I think you are the first person in
    Ta-tjenen whom I've heard admit to really hating somebody.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It could well be. A disease which seems peculiar to
    Time Keepers, unfortunately.</q> Alhane rose. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I
    think it is time to check my father's data.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    He walked into the other room, where old binders were piled from floor to
    ceiling. Oddly enough—or perhaps not—his father's notebooks were on the
    bottom of the pile. Alhane yanked out the bottommost and the whole pile
    scattered over the floor. Alhane fell along with them and Stringer slapped
    his thighs in laughter. Then they got to work examining the notes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Listen to this!</q> Alhane exclaimed after the third
    book was opened. <q ab:speaker="Alhane" class="no-close-quote"><q>Contained
    in these books are two dozen Patra-Bannks' worth of data that I have
    collected pertaining to the motion of the stars, in particular the one I
    call the Runaway. I have observed the stars with painstaking care long
    enough so that I am convinced that they repeat their positions in the
    manner shown herein. Assuming this repeatability at constant intervals, it
    follows that we should be able to use the positions of the stars to set our
    clocks, and indeed, I have done this for the last several Patra-Bannks,
    finding that I can predict sunrise with great accuracy without having to
    make many excursions Above immediately before the dawn. This should benefit
    all future timekeeping.</q></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Unbelievable!</q> Alhane cried with a squeak. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane" class="no-close-quote">The stars repeat their
    positions! What an amazing idea!  To use the stars as clocks instead of
    clocking them! I thank you, Father!  Look, he continues:</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane" class="no-close-quote"><q>I ardently hope that these
    heavenly motions, which seem to me most intervolved and beyond
    comprehension, may, in a future Patra, point the way to some understanding
    of Patra-Bannk's place in the Universe. I say this because repeated failure
    on my part to deduce the orbit of the Runaway around Patra-Bannk from these
    data may indicate that Patra-Bannk is not the Center of our cosmos. When my
    son is a little older, I will speak to him about carrying on the work,
    although at his present age he seems rather disinclined to the
    profession. Signed, Annel, Time Keeper after Arpen.</q></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Well, how about that? Thank you, Annel. Tell me
    truthfully, Stringer, did you know this was here?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, it was a reasonable guess, that's all.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Well, I will have to check his data. I hope it is
    useful. Of course, he must be wrong about displacing Patra-Bannk from the
    Center.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, I wouldn't worry about it too much.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Why not?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer smiled a cockeyed smile. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Once somebody
    told me—when I was much younger—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You couldn't have been much younger or you would
    have been a baby.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Merely a child. He told me that the Universe is
    collapsing on itself, that once everything was expanding and now it is
    collapsing, and that sooner or later everything will get very hot and we
    will all be crushed together in the center.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you mean all those stars are falling on
    Patra-Bannk?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes. And since that is going to happen and
    everyone will be killed, I don't see much point in worrying about things
    like that, because the worry will never amount to anything in the end.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane wrinkled his nose. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You don't strike me as the
    philosophical type, Stringer—if you strike me as anything at all. Tell me,
    does this bother you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, but I thought it might bother you; that's why
    I brought it up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Hmm. Yes, you're right. Is there anything that can
    be done about it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Stopping the Universe from ending? Who could do
    that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Indeed, who could do that? Well, if everything is
    going to be destroyed, I'd say we'd better move all the faster for it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Right. And we do have a sailplane that wants
    finishing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes, yes, I'll be with you shortly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer knew what that meant and thought he'd better get to work himself.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">And this, My Stringer, is how we are going to get
    south?</q> Taljen surveyed the sailplane whose fuselage was now almost
    solid and whose long, slender wings were taking final shape on the bench
    next to it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer ducked under a wing tip and flexed the new joint to test its
    strength. Before the Going Under, Stringer had cannibalized what remained
    of <em>Number One</em>'s left wing in order to use it as a model for the
    cross section of the wings for his glider. Now he fervently hoped the
    transfer would be successful.
  </p>

  <p>
    He turned to a nearby stove which Alhane had installed and lit the fire,
    placing on it a pot of hard resin refined from the pod-trees. After it had
    melted and filled the room with stink, he took a brush and started painting
    the hot liquid on the body of the sailplane. The resin was hard and strong
    when cooled and would make a good substitute for the plastic normally used
    to make sailplanes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">And what is that for?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Polish to make the glider smooth. A rough surface
    will mean a disturbed airflow and kilometers lost. That isn't allowed.</q>
    Stringer lapsed into silence and continued brushing on the first layer of
    the outer shell of the plane.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen tossed back her hair. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Can I help?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer smiled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes. Paint this on as smoothly as
    possible. Don't let it drip.</q> He handed her the bucket and got to work
    filing down a protruding nailhead. The grating annoyed Taljen's ears, the
    same ears that were at home with a thirty-one-tone musical scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Won't you stop that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Sorry, it's necessary. More kilometers.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They continued to work together for a few beclads until Taljen put her
    brush into the bucket and watched it sink beneath the surface of the
    resin. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Did you ever figure out your gravity?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer remained silent for so long a time that Taljen gave up hoping he
    would reply. Unexpectedly he spoke. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you think a
    planet could be formed hollow? Sort of have a big cavity on the inside?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I suppose so. The sky is hollow, so
    why not a planet?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span ab:speaker="Stringer">Why not?</span> Stringer repeated to
    himself. <span ab:speaker="Stringer">Why not?</span>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The Patra drifted onward with the stars. The wait seemed endless to
    Stringer, but he knew it could not last forever. All the light tanks had
    flickered out long ago, their dynamos either frozen or broken by the winds
    or both. Now the halls were lined with ducted torches. Alhane was seen less
    and less as he became more and more absorbed with the problems of
    timekeeping and astronomy. All his life he had considered the two
    activities separately. The sun kept time—when, during the Bannk, its shadow
    could be seen through clouds or haze; stars were a rarely seen curiosity,
    so rarely seen as to be ignored. After studying his father's data, it was
    clear to Alhane that timekeeping and astronomy were one and the same. And
    now he might really have the opportunity to live up to his title of Time
    Keeper.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen and Stringer continued to work on the sailplane. Stringer scavenged
    the Junk for controls; used viewport material from the old Polkraitz ships
    to fashion a good canopy for the cockpit that was smooth and had wide
    visibility. He trusted his intuition. Pike had trained him well, and now
    the training was going to pay off. It had to.
  </p>

  <p>
    He tried to put gravity out of his mind and concentrate on the work he was
    doing. But occasionally, disturbing thoughts of hollow planets invaded his
    mind. When that happened, he did not sleep well. And he was not sleeping
    well now, even though, as always, he was sleeping in Taljen's arms. His
    tossing and rolling kept her awake, too, so she rose and went to the
    nearest communal room. Well, she had been sleeping too much lately, anyway,
    with this Alien around.
  </p>

  <p>
    The room was practically empty because most of the people in this section
    of town slept at approximately the same time. So she went to another and
    sat there for a while, watching the lively dancing and games. Some telclads
    went by without Taljen's having the urge to join in the fun. She was
    getting bored and was considering leaving when Kenken Wer sat down next to
    her.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen stood up.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Sit down with me, Tall Taljen,</q> Kenken Wer
    said with genuine politeness. Taljen obliged and sat down again in her
    usual cross-legged fashion, her hands on her knees. <q ab:speaker="Kenken
    Wer">I am told you are going south with the Alien.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Words cannot be kept boxed up in Ta-tjenen, that is
    certain.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Why are you going?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen's voice lowered slightly in pitch, enough so that another Tjenen
    would certainly notice it. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I'm not sure, Kenken Wer,
    but it is clearly time to go.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The old woman leaned back against the wall and listened to the strong beat
    of the music for a moment. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You've changed much,
    Taljen, much, I think, since the Alien came. It has been a long time since
    I have seen you dance. I have never seen anyone spend so much time with one
    nesta before. You used to mingle; everyone was so close to you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Is that unusual? Who is not close to anyone
    here?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer shook her head sadly. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">You are not
    happy because of the Alien. We can get another nesta for you if you
    wish. Staying with the Alien is perverse. Do you realize he committed the
    first murder here since the revolt? How can you wish to stay with such a…an
    <em>Alien</em>?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">How can I wish to be with anyone? One is as good as
    another here, all good, all bad, even Stringer. He will do for now, as all
    nesta.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">How will a murderer and a Polkraitz do?</q>
    Kenken Wer shouted. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Why do you want to pollute
    yourself with his presence?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen stabilized her voice. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Because I think he may
    know something about the world that Ta-tjenen may not know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">What can he know that is not self-evident?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">He says that Patra-Bannk is round, like a ball, that
    he understands how gravity works—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">What nonsense! Do you believe him, Taljen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Not yet, but Alhane does.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Alhane! Half the cause of all this! Do you
    believe him, that old Time Keeper?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">She never has,</q> Alhane said as he walked into the
    room, <q ab:speaker="Alhane">but she will go and see.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen nodded mutely.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">See what?</q> Kenken Wer demanded, rising to her
    feet. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Do you want to see her swallowed up by the
    collector of winds? Or falling off the Edge of the World?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">There is no Edge of the World, I am convinced. My
    experiments, I thank them, show—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Your experiments! Have we not picked enough
    holes in them? Look around you, Alhane! Is it not clear that the world is
    flat? Where do the winds go if not collected when they get south?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I don't know,</q> Alhane replied honestly. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">A new mechanism will have to be devised.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It is unlikely, Alhane, old Teacher,</q> Taljen
    said. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You will have to explain many things,
    including Stringer's gravity.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">If it is right, mind you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It is better than yours, and the discrepancy with
    what we feel is easily explained if the world is flat.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer nodded in approval.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane stammered, <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But—but my data indicates that the
    world is round and that new mechanisms will have to be devised—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Your data again. Next you will be telling us,
    Time Keeper, that Ta-tjenen is not the Center.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">If that is the case, then I will say that—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen shook her head slowly. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Alhane, that is very
    hard to believe.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer did not relent. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">I have seen your data
    when you presented it to the nestrexam. Do you think us unintelligent
    fools? You and your minute shadows. What can they say? Look around you. All
    is flat; Ta-tjenen is all there is in the world, other than Glintz and
    Godrhan. You look north, south, east, or west, and but for the hills, the
    distance looks the same. It follows that we are central. And has anyone
    ever sailed around? No. But if the world was as you say, one could sail
    around—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Your problem is simple, Time Keeper Alhane: you
    do not know how to see with your eyes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane spun around, glaring at Kenken Wer's wrinkles. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">And your problem, Kenken Wer Who Stands at the Center,
    is that you do not know how to see with your imagination!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer recovered quickly. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">I should hope
    not. Imagination is for your dreams, Alhane; we are talking about
    reality.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Reality is not determined by referendum—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">—nor by wishful thinking on the part of one
    man. I won't let you send Taljen off with that Alien to be swallowed up
    with the winds or fall off the Edge of the World.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I will go,</q> Taljen said softly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Then you believe Alhane?</q> Kenken Wer asked,
    startled. She had assumed she had won the argument.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No, I hope he is wrong.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Then you want to die past Godrhan, disappearing
    off the face of the world?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No, whoever heard of anyone wanting to die?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Then why are you going?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Because things aren't the same any more, because I
    must find out.</q> Taljen walked quickly away from the old woman, leaving
    her alone amid the music and dance that had continued uninterrupted by the
    argument. Alhane walked off also, in another direction, not remembering why
    he had entered in the first place.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was sitting up on the mat when Taljen returned, crying. He sat
    shivering, staring at the walls with eyes widened and jaw hanging. Taljen
    forgot her tears.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer jumped up, glanced sharply at Taljen, then turned quickly
    away. Taljen knelt beside him and steadied his shaking body with her
    own. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer, I've never seen you like this. What
    is it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer stood up and poured himself a glass of water, thus exceeding his
    ration. He drank the water in one gulp, then poured himself another.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What is it?</q> Taljen repeated.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I was having trouble
    sleeping. The gravity was bothering me. I don't know…I was having
    nightmares.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Can you tell me what it was?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I can't really remember. It was horrifying. Almost
    like someone deep inside my brain trying to tell me something. Sometimes my
    dreams are so real, it is almost as if someone else were trying to talk to
    me.…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen sat down in front of Stringer, facing him. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Does this happen often?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer hesitated for a long time. deciding whether he wanted to
    answer. He began to speak slowly. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Off and on, for
    as long as I can remember. When something is bothering me, I can never
    sleep. Sometimes, like now, it is horrible because…because I don't have
    control. Do you understand?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen shook her head.
  </p>

  <p>
    Again Stringer hesitated, holding his fists clenched, this time trying to
    find a way to explain. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Put a kalan in my hand
    and…and suddenly I have an almost conscious control over my entire
    self. Put me to sleep and I am knocked around in my dreams as if I am their
    puppet: torn, murdered, ripped in half, put back together again. I hate to
    sleep; there is no control. But there is something in sleep. I am sure that
    I do most of my thinking in dreams. Often, when I awake, I have the
    solution to what's been bothering me. Not this time. If only I could use
    dreams the way I use my kalan…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer sighed in puzzlement. He left the room to work on the
    sailplane. He had to be south at Bannk's beginning. If that wasn't clear
    before, it was clear now. Because the answers would be there with Pike and
    his magic city.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Nineteen</div>Trapped by a Planet
  and a Friend</h2>

  <p>
    It was long after Mid-Patra, and, as usual, the Gostum were training. The
    Gostum were always training for something, although Paddelack never quite
    understood why or against whom, unless his own discipline theory was, in
    fact, the answer. But now that they had a Commander, they trained even more
    fervently. Paddelack himself, at this moment, had a sword in hand but found
    that he tired easily. There seemed so little air to breathe here during the
    Patra. That might explain why the Gostum were so amazingly strong, always
    training with so little air. Pike, though, seemed to be enjoying himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    There he was, his sword against Karrxlyn's ax. Karrxlyn swung heavily, and
    Paddelack was sure that the blow would cleave Pike in two, but Pike neatly
    avoided it. Pike's sword, however, was in the way and snapped under the
    crushing blow; the sharp twang of breaking metal resounded throughout the
    room. Karrxlyn leaped; Pike backed up. Suddenly, in mid-flight it seemed,
    Karrxlyn winced and stopped his charge. A small trickle of blood oozed from
    his shoulder as a gleaming metal object flashed by.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Don't worry,</q> Pike laughed, but in a serious
    voice. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I didn't poison it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    He left Karrxlyn standing in amazement in the middle of the floor, received
    his cape from an attendant, and walked over to Paddelack. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">There's something I've been meaning to talk to you
    about,</q> he said.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack pulled his raven's nose. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Tell me,
    what's that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">It has been suggested that you move into your own
    quarters.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack cocked his head. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Why? No, don't tell
    me. They think we're having an affair.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike didn't laugh. <q ab:speaker="Pike">But, after all, I am Commander, am
    I not?</q> Scenes flashed quickly; the cold air creeping into the emergency
    chamber; fires; huddling. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, I am Commander, am I
    not?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack glanced briefly at the ground, pulled on his nose again, and
    looked up once more into Pike's eyes. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I'll tell
    you this, Pike,</q> he said in Bitter. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Fooling
    the Gostum into thinking you're Polkraitz is fine with me and may have its
    uses. But be careful about fooling yourself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">This is the Golun-Patra,</q> Pike answered with a sly
    smile, <q ab:speaker="Pike">and we have done some amazing things, wouldn't
    you agree?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I'll agree that theorizing by coincidences will
    get you into a lot of trouble.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">When the coincidences become large in number, one
    begins to wonder, doesn't one?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">One begins to become a fanatic,</q> Paddelack
    grumbled.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike overheard this, glared at the thin man, and turned away. The storm of
    dust that was swept up by his cape blew into Paddelack's eyes.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Paddelack moved out of Pike's chamber very shortly, in fact,
    immediately. His new quarters were, by Liddlefuran standards, still quite
    regal, so he didn't complain. He did, however, sneeze often, since for some
    reason the heating system was faulty in this section of Konndjlan and his
    room was cold. But at least he wasn't awakened when a guard would enter to
    get Pike, so now he could sleep <q>late.</q> Whatever that meant.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally the cold became too annoying, and Paddelack discovered that despite
    the maze of passageways needed to reach it, the workroom containing his
    newly built steam engine was, in fact, nearby. Using scraps of old
    Polkraitz equipment from the storerooms, he fashioned a crude radiator for
    his room; and after hacking a hole through several walls and floors—a
    process that took more than a beclad—he connected it to the steam
    engine. He ran back to his room to enjoy the heat but ended up enjoying
    only the clanking and rattling of the pipe works. After several more
    beclads of this noise he had had enough and shut the contraption off.
  </p>

  <p>
    Occasionally Paddelack's thoughts would turn back to Daryephna and ahead to
    Triesk. The metallic hydrogen might be there; rockets were certainly
    there; the explanation of the Polkraitz was likely to be there. The major
    intersection at Triesk was clearly marked on the huge map. Pike's reasoning
    had an annoying grain of consistency running through it that made
    refutation difficult, even though sometimes it seemed totally mad. But
    perhaps he was right and Triesk held the answers. The wait would be worth
    the cold and the sneezing.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    While he waited, Paddelack continued working on the steam system for the
    Gostum. At first he wasn't sure why he did it, since he was convinced that
    the result would be no better than what the Gostum had already and would
    not solve the ventilation problem, only alleviate it, and any modifications
    he could make in the Patra remaining would be minimal. When he showed the
    Gostum engineers how to use their steam engine as a pump, they became very
    excited, and the activity in the shops increased threefold.
  </p>

  <p>
    But Paddelack came to know that his activity was merely a desperate attempt
    to keep his mind off the clocks, the clocks that showed that the Patra was
    rapidly drawing to a close. But the attempt did not work. Every time he
    neared the great hall, he could feel his pulse beat faster and faster as he
    stole a glance at the two timepieces. Now they differed by a full
    beclad. Paddelack could only gnaw at his lip because there was absolutely
    no way to tell which was correct. An extra beclad to wait if the slower one
    was telling the truth. Could he stand it? No. This time as Paddelack neared
    the council chamber, the clock was unbearable to him, each clack resounding
    through the halls. This time he could not stand to <em>see</em> how much
    longer he might have to wait. He turned and ran away from the sounds of the
    swinging pendulum and foliot bars, down the corridors to the stables.
  </p>

  <p>
    He pulled the lever that lowered the floor. Far off, the steam from a
    buried mechanism whistled and the platform slowly sank. In front of
    Paddelack was the first of the three great wooden doors that separated him
    from the outside world. He grimaced and slammed the bolts aside and heaved
    the door open, hurling it against the tunnel wall. The crash reverberated
    for endless seconds. Then he passed to the second door, shivering, breath
    condensing out of the air. He regarded the iron strapping for a moment, set
    his jaw, and unbolted that one, too.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Creak!</em> screamed the door as he pulled it open.
  </p>

  <p>
    The subfreezing air hit his body. Paddelack brushed the tears away and ran
    to the thickest, final door, the only one keeping him from the
    Patra. Shaking, almost numb, he pounded away at the heavy wood, reinforced
    with ancient metal.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Curse you!</q> he cried again and again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now he crumpled to his knees and his body shook with convulsive sobs. After
    a few moments he slowly stood up, walked past the second door, and shut it
    behind him with its great creak shouting in protest. He passed the inner
    door and pulled it close with a deep thud. He swiveled around, hit it once
    with his fist, and returned to the stables.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    How did the Gostum do it? Paddelack asked himself for the hundredth
    time. At least on Massarat, the incredible easiness about everything,
    variable families included, went a long way to explain the ability to cope
    with the Patra. But the Gostum, although biologically identical, didn't use
    that system. Paddelack wished he could change his body rhythm at will to a
    Patra-Bannk per cycle, but he knew he couldn't. He could do nothing but
    pound and wait. As the depression gave way to embarrassment, Paddelack
    paced absently toward the great hall.
  </p>

  <p>
    The council was in session. Effrulyn and his fixed Angles were there. So
    was Fara-Ny, whose myriad wrinkles well disguised his intentions. Karrxlyn,
    the warrior, never strayed far from Pike, and so all were gathered and
    already talking when Paddelack walked in late, having paced there by
    coincidence. He had not known the time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Now,</q> Pike was in the process of saying, <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">I plan on using the stala to do some investigating of my
    own and see if anything can be discovered. I have promised to help you, and
    the stala will make things easier in that regard.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">But the Fear, Commander. Only certain Elsewheres
    are open to us because the Fear is absent.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, I know. I will be careful.</q> Pike could not
    help but remember that moment in Daryephna. The encounter had been brief,
    but something had stuck in his head. A single word or Command waiting to be
    crystallized. It meant nothing now, but it would. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Now,</q> he continued, <q ab:speaker="Pike">your sources
    indicate that Triesk is a large city, something over ten thousand. Which
    means we will need help from others…Ah, Paddelack. Sit down. Tell us, do
    you think the Liddlefurans will come to our aid?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack blinked and brushed away the dirt from his hand. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Aid? For what?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">In case we should need them against Triesk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Why should we?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Reconnaissance shows that Triesk has many more
    inhabitants than Konndjlan. Therefore we will need reinforcements. Perhaps
    even more than Massarat can provide.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack pulled his nose and squinted his eyes. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Hold on here. Why do we need reinforcements at
    all?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">If we have to mount a siege, it will not be easy.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Siege! Sarek, who said anything about a siege?
    You said we would go up there and take a look and see what was there and
    help these Gostum find what they wanted. A siege?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Calm down, Paddy, my friend. The Gostum have already
    asked the Trieskans for help but can't even get negotiations started. We
    must issue a final ultimatum, but, of course, we must be prepared for the
    eventuality that it will be refused. No decision has yet been made—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">My eye, no decision had yet been made! I knew
    something like this was going to happen. Do you see what you've gotten
    into?</q> Paddelack was already on his feet. He took a last look at the
    ventilated torches whose soot, left from the Bannk, smudged the relief
    above them, took a last look at the two clocks on the dais, one short and
    squat, the other tall and slender, both noisy, then turned around and began
    walking toward the archway.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Remember, we have promised to help the Gostum. We must
    be good to our word. Everyone must be taken away from Patra-Bannk. To stay
    on a world like this is perpetual madness. Don't you see what we are trying
    to do? We are simply trying to help, and they need my leadership. Isn't
    that clear even to you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack was, by this time, almost out of the room. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">No! I won't have anything to do with it. Be
    Commander for all I care. I'm going back to Massarat.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Fara-Ny coughed, and Karrxlyn leaped in front on Paddelack with sword
    drawn.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No,</q> Pike called, and he laughed. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Let him go. He'll be back. After all, he's a suicide
    case, anyway.</q> Then he spoke to Paddelack directly. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Just inform Massarat of our desire to be honored by their
    assistance.</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Twenty</div>Daybreak in the North:
  The Journey Begins</h2>

  <p>
    Depending on who you were and what you believed, there were at least three
    ways of viewing the motion of the sun around Patra-Bannk. If you were of
    Ta-tjenen, all the Patras and Bannks were the same length—six teclads—and,
    timewise, the sun always climbed at a constant rate per teclad. If, on
    the other hand, you were Gostum, the Bannks varied in length and the time
    between sunrise and noon of one Bannk wasn't even nearly the same as during
    another. Thus, the sun did not move at a constant rate; it moved according
    to its whim, sometimes shooting across the sky, sometimes—during the Weird
    Bannk—seeming to hover as though lifeless near the horizon for teclads on
    end before deciding to get on with its journey. Of course, varying the
    angle in the sky added a third possibility, and if you were Effrulyn, it
    didn't matter and you could have it all ways at once.
  </p>

  <p>
    But, to a first approximation, you could say that the terminator crawled to
    Konndjlan and Ta-tjenen at the rate of less than one degree per Two-Bit
    day. The air became colder until the windows from the terminator started
    pumping heat into the dark side. And then the winds grew violently
    turbulent, as they had been at sunset.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally came the sun, which a few hardy Tjenens witnessed. They had gone
    Above several times during the last beclad to make sure it was coming,
    because by Patra's end, Alhane's clocks were often off by more than a
    beclad, and Alhane still didn't trust his father's data. The sky was
    already light and the last stars had faded from view. Stringer found
    himself anticipating the day with a greater eagerness than he could ever
    remember having waited for anything. How many months in the dark? He
    couldn't remember; months meant nothing. How many kilometers paced in
    claustrophobic confinement? Uncountable. And now the sun was coming, any
    moment now. Alhane was wrapped in quazzat, eyes on pedestaled transit,
    ready to call down to his daughter at the first trace of the sun so that
    she could set the master clock. Why weren't all the other Tjenens Above to
    witness the event? How could they stay Below? Stringer wondered as the
    cryogenic air howled around his head and he steadied himself against the
    house.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then he saw the trace above the western horizon. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">There it is!</q> he shouted, trying to lift his voice
    above the wind. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">There it is!</q> He jumped and
    pointed. It was only the minutest of lines above the far plains, but it was
    the sun. And Stringer waited for the glorious sun to rise and illuminate
    the world, ready to bask in its life-giving rays. But it remained where it
    was, not moving, laughingly defying him. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Come
    on!</q> he yelled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do something!</q> The sun, as
    always, didn't listen, and Taljen caught his arm and took him Below. Now
    Stringer understood why the Tjenens didn't bother with sunrises.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    It was now four beclads after sunrise, Killer Bannk beclads, a third again
    as long as those of the Weird Bannk. Stringer paced the Under
    nervously. Every minute, every second, every clad, belclad, and telclad were
    important now, but it was still too cold and windy for him to move. He kept
    himself occupied by putting the last touches on the sailplane. Alhane,
    taking time off from his new hobby, helped by painting an outline of a bird
    on the nose, wings, body, and tail. He said it was a solofar, a giant bird
    that Stringer had only heard about. Alhane wanted to call the sailplane
    <em>Bidrift</em>, which was a small cousin of the legendary
    solofar. Stringer couldn't understand why Alhane wanted to call the craft a
    bidrift after claiming he had painted it as a solofar, but in any case,
    Stringer thought that <em>One Shot</em> was a more appropriate name. Alhane
    refused to be pessimistic, and they compromised by calling the sailplane
    <em>Nothing</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, even that chore was finished, and Stringer could only pace or
    play his rodoft for the dances. But his heart was not in the music, if it
    ever had been.
  </p>

  <p>
    When finally someone entered the communal room and announced that it was
    time to go Above, Stringer almost threw his rodoft in the air. Candles were
    lit and lines to the Gateway were formed. Stringer marched out among the
    chatty Tjenens, warmly dressed, holding his candle. The attendant at the
    Gateway was about to extinguish Stringer's candle as he emerged, but a gust
    of wind blew it out beforehand. So goes the ceremony, Stringer thought
    happily.
  </p>

  <p>
    He watched the Tjenens disperse, the constant talk turning to silence as
    they emerged from the tunnel. They gathered into their appropriate
    nestrexas and set about finding their new houses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer looked about him. The roof of the meeting tent was almost gone; he
    himself had seen it fall. In fact, most of Ta-tjenen seemed to be
    leveled. The nearest houses were all either completely collapsed or rent by
    huge gashes in their sides. Pieces of netting were strewn over the ground
    as far as he could see, and bits of wood were tuck into the frozen snow. At
    his feet, any bare spots on the plaza showed new cracks from expanding ice
    during the long Short Patra. The pod-trees around the park were, for the
    most part, still erect, except for a few unlucky ones, and they were all
    still closed, insulating resin completely solid. The Tjenens would have
    much resurrecting to do. Stringer walked around, climbed up to the numerous
    reservoirs that opened below, peered in, and saw ice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen found him later. Already her skin, like that of a chameleon, had
    darkened several shades, and her eyes were no longer the light blue of the
    Patra. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Will you help with the repairs?</q> she asked
    him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I have work of my own to do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer, you can do nothing quite yet. Help with
    the repairs. You are in Ta-tjenen still, and at Bannk's beginning everyone
    helps with the repairs. Everyone. And do not be anxious. This is not a
    Bannk to look forward to, especially in our solofar.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">All right.</q> Stringer gave in. He glanced
    briefly to the west and was glad to see more of the sun.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Another two beclads passed before the town looked any cleaner and before
    Stringer dared take out the sailplane. He detached the wings and searched
    out Alhane. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How are we going to get it
    outside?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">The door, obviously. Look here, Stringer.</q> Alhane
    showed him a door in the old storeroom that Stringer had not noticed all
    Patra. It opened to a sheltered spot not halfway up the hill on which
    Ta-tjenen sat.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Time Keeper's children were called upon to help, as was Taljen, and the
    craft was carefully taken out of the storeroom and down the hill. They
    loaded it onto a large flat cart, and Stringer watched Alhane's son, whose
    name was Alhen, whip the grask into action. The five of them walked down
    the shore road to the east as the glider made its first short journey. On
    the last rise before the sea Stringer saw the frozen ocean. Indeed, it was
    visible from the top of Ta-tjenen, but Stringer had not noticed it. He
    noticed it now, though, a vast, unbroken plain of frosty white stretching
    interminably. Only near the edge of the beach was water beginning to replace
    ice as the yellow sun crawled up into the air.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a short while the wings were securely in place and Stringer was sitting
    in the cockpit. Long, light cables from the shuttle connected the glider to
    the grask team on the beach, leaving thin trails in fast-melting snow and
    mud.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you want to try it, Stringer? It is still very
    windy.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It will always be very windy!</q> Stringer shouted
    in reply and bit his lip.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane shut the hood over Stringer's head and waved to the others on the
    beach.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer saw the cables grow taut and felt the glider begin to slide across
    the ground. The wind buffeted the plane and he had to force himself to
    relax. The ground grated by and suddenly there was no more sound. Stringer
    looked down; he was in the air. A push of the lever and the cables were
    gone. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Up! Up!</q> he urged. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Take me up!</q> He felt the controls in his
    hands. They felt good; it had been a long time. A little too much roll this
    way, a tendency to slip that way. The rudder was stiff; the elevators, a
    little sticky. Stringer made mental notes as he watched the ground below
    him streak by. He found a current of rising air and soared. He found an air
    wave over a hill and rose higher. He had to exercise great restraint in
    order not to fly away right then and leave Ta-tjenen behind him forever. He
    searched for a landing spot and hit the wind crosswise. The plane lurched
    and slipped. He tightened his grip on the stick and remembered rusted skills
    not used for Patra-Bannks. The landing was rough, the ground came up fast,
    but <em>Nothing</em> bounced twice on its wheel and slid to a halt,
    undamaged. Stringer pushed the hood back and looked around. He saw his
    friends come riding down the beach on graskback. Snow and dirt were flung
    into the air behind flying hooves.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You did it!</q> the Time Keeper cried.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">How was it?</q> Taljen yelled as she dismounted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was backslapped by all. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Rough wind. But
    it flew and that's good. We have to make some adjustments yet. And with you
    in it.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Stringer worked constantly for a beclad on trimming the sailplane for
    flight. He forced himself to go without sleep as the sun urged him on with
    its headlong chariot ride into heaven. Why couldn't that sun move at a
    constant rate? Always too fast when time was scarce and too slow when he
    didn't need it. The line of ice was receding from the beach as the sun's
    heat turned it into freezing water, and the snow on the beach was almost
    gone now, fast melting into nothing. Stringer eventually satisfied himself
    that he had a plane that would handle well and had a glide ratio of at
    least twenty to one, not good for a Two-Bit glider, which easily made
    seventy or eighty, but respectable for a homemade monster. He took one more
    look at the sun and the beach and the snow and knew it was time to leave.
  </p>

  <p>
    He walked briskly to the shuttle for his tent and grasers. Even before he
    entered, he remembered the exile and climbed anxiously into the craft. In
    the cargo compartment, empty ration packets were neatly stacked up on one
    side, and his tent, rolled into its sack, was laid across two
    seats. Stringer checked all the compartments and the latrine. They were
    empty.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, good luck to us,</q> he said, and departed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Shortly after Stringer reached the beach, the crowd began to form. He
    glanced at Taljen and she nodded. Word traveled quickly indeed in
    Ta-tjenen. He did not recognize any faces at this distance. He wondered how
    many were friends, those for whom he had played the rodoft, and he wondered
    how many were enemies, those who thought of him as an evil Polkraitz come
    back to destroy them. He was sure that most would be happy to have him
    leave, and he was glad to oblige.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane walked along the crowded road on his way to the beach and mingled
    with the spectators.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">I'll bet you are glad to see him off, Time
    Keeper,</q> Benjfold said in his rising voice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane sighed at the young man. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Glad? I don't know,
    even if you do. The Alien asked interesting questions, which no one else
    here asks. But he was troublesome, even I will admit to that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Troublesome! I hope this insane trip kills him for
    his gift of troubles!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Not a child's punishment, this trip, whether the sun
    acts benevolently or not.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Does he deserve a child's punishment? After
    killing the girl—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You speak strangely, Benjfold.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Is it any wonder? The Alien has done this to all
    of us. He tried to kill me, you remember—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">—and even myself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">You?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes,</q> Alhane chuckled. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It
    was near the end of the Bannk when we found the exile Above. Stringer
    helped him by sheltering him in the shuttle—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Are you telling the truth?</q> Benjfold cried.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I have no reason not to.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Then he must be stopped now! Immediately! He is
    Polkraitz in league with the Gostum and must be stopped!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But—</q> Alhane raised his arm, but Benjfold had
    already lost himself among the throngs of people.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane did not try to find Benjfold to reason with him, nor Kenken Wer to
    stop what he knew would shortly be a disaster. He ran out to the beach,
    struggling over his slight limp until he reached the glider. The crowd was
    already moving in his direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Stringer, you must go now! Go! Hurry! Don't wait or
    you'll be killed. The found out about the exile. It was my fault. Go! Go!
    Don't wait for the sun!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer saw Benjfold break away from the crowd and begin running toward
    them.
  </p>

  <p>
    He nodded sharply to Alhane and got into the cockpit, where Taljen was
    already waiting.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Remember to keep a record for me, Stringer!</q>
    Alhane said, patting Stringer on the back with one hand and signaling to
    the waiting grask team with the other. He stepped back just in time to
    avoid the tail of the moving sailplane and being hit by a rock thrown from
    the mob.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Rise, <em>Bidrift</em>, rise!</q> Alhane shouted
    from the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Up, <em>Nothing!</em> Sarek, get up!</q> Stringer
    urged from the cockpit. He saw the crowd approaching from the corner of his
    eye and winced. When he dared look again, they were falling behind with the
    ground. A flick of the release lever and the glider was free; a rising air
    current discovered and they were up; the southerly wind caught and they
    were away. Stringer allowed himself a deep sigh of relief, but Taljen
    remained tense.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You have two things to explain to me, Stringer,</q>
    she said from behind him. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">One is what that was all
    about, and the other is how to fly this bird.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I helped the man who was left Above for the
    Patra. They just found out.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Although Stringer couldn't see Taljen, her face grew pale and she pressed
    her hands over her eyes. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You didn't,</q> was all she
    could say.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer grinned, purposely sardonic. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How does it
    feel to be cooped up with a Polkraitz traitor?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen sucked in her breath. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Teach me to operate
    this bird.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded to himself. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, Ta-tjenen is
    behind us now.</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Twenty-One</div>Daybreak in the
  South: Other Journeys Begin</h2>

  <p>
    As was his duty, Pike stood on the windswept balcony from which he had
    first witnessed the great western desert. His cape blew violently behind
    him, tangling with that of Effrulyn, who held the Angles in thickly gloved
    hands. Fara-Ny, bundled up in great quantities of clothing, was
    unrecognizable. Karrxlyn stood by, too, only his eyes visible, and also one
    of the astronomers, who had one hand on a mounted stick and one eye on the
    mountaintops, kilometers above their heads. When the tip of the mountain
    turned white, the astronomer brought his attention to his transit and fixed
    his eye to the crosspiece.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wait was agonizing. Eventually the astronomer mumbled, <q
    ab:speaker="Gostum astronomer">I think that might be it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What was that?</q> Pike shouted into the roaring wind.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum astronomer">I said, I think that might be it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">You're not sure?</q> Effrulyn asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum astronomer">It might just be a diffraction off the
    desert.…Now, is that it? No, maybe now…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Oh, come on. Pick a time.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The astronomer paid no attention to Effrulyn. Suddenly everyone exclaimed
    at once: <q ab:speaker="Pike, Effrulyn, Fara-Ny, and Karrxlyn together">Yes, there it is!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The astronomer looked up, startled. <q ab:speaker="Gostum astronomer">Yes,
    I guess so.</q> He cupped his eye to his mouth and called down the corridor
    that opened behind them: <q ab:speaker="Gostum
    astronomer"><em>Sunrise!</em></q> The call was relayed to the great hall
    and the clocks were set.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum">The clocks are set!</q> came the answering call.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">How much was the new clock off?</q> Effrulyn
    asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum astronomer">What was the error?</q> the astronomer
    called.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum">Quarter of a beclad plus quarter of a telclad!</q>
    came the distant answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum astronomer">Not good,</q> the astronomer said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">But,</q> Effrulyn asked, <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">by how much is the old master clock in error?</q>
    Again the call was sent after a moment the answer received.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum">A full beclad plus a telclad.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">So let us look at these records.</q> Effrulyn
    snatched the sheets the astronomer had kept since early Patra, when the
    pendulum clock had been finished. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Here is where
    the final adjustments were made and the new clock set to the old, about a
    quarter of the way into the Patra. Now we see a progressive discrepancy
    between the old clock and the new as the Patra wears on. The discrepancy
    seems more or less linear, so let us assume that the old one was off by a
    quarter of a beclad when the final set on the new one was made. That means
    the remaining quarter of a telclad is the error in the new. Not bad, I'd
    say. But then this whole discussion is meaningless because it assumes that
    the sun tells some metaphysical absolute time, and I see little
    justification for putting so much confidence in the physical world. So you
    astronomers and clockmakers can do as you will.</q> Effrulyn smiled at the
    frowning astronomer and walked inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later, when he passed through the great hall, the old clock had been
    removed, leaving the new pendulum clock on the dais alone, clacking away to
    disturb his thoughts.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The sun was not yet quite up and the sky was gray-clear, but that only made
    it seem colder to Paddelack as he tugged and yanked the stubborn grask
    along the road to Massarat. Finally the stupid animal refused to budge a
    centimeter. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You think I like this, animal?</q>
    Paddelack yelled. The grask didn't answer, just knelt where it
    was. Paddelack wasn't in the mood to argue. He took a beclad's worth of
    provisions from the animal's back. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Your fur
    should keep you warm! Bah!</q> He left the grask there.
  </p>

  <p>
    The terminator was not a good place to be, Paddelack decided for the second
    time as he trudged on through the snow, the terminator where the cold
    hemisphere met the warm there and giant air masses clashed head-on. Of
    course, if the great Gostum debate didn't finally decide that the planet
    was round, they would never begin to understand how weather worked—if it
    was possible to understand weather at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    As he entered the gorge that cut through the mountain, Paddelack was first
    staggered, then felled, by winds roaring through at hurricane force. When
    he eventually managed to regain his feet while clinging to a rock, he could
    see that the highest peaks gleamed white. Soon the shadow began dropping
    away from the Massarat range, the light invaded the crags, and the desert
    became bright with the tangential rays of the rising sun. Paddelack stood
    and watched it happen, stubbornly slow. It happened so slowly that after
    the first beam flashing into his eyes, Paddelack swore that he could count
    the seconds before it crawled from the tip of his bird-beaked nose, across
    the snout of his oversized parka, and down his skinny legs to the heels of
    his tightly tied boots. He whistled through his teeth, waved to the newborn
    sun, and trudged on his way.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    When Paddelack reached Massarat, no one was outside to greet him. Well, he
    couldn't blame them, could he? This he thought as he was blown over again
    by the wind and received his <em>n</em>th bruise—where <em>n</em> is a very
    large number. Paddelack climbed the iced-over steps, slipping twice, and
    pulled the bell rope. Soon somebody opened the door a crack, and a single
    eyeball peered out at him, gazing down the snout of his hood. <q
    ab:speaker="Liddlefuran gatekeeper">Paddelack!</q> the voice exclaimed
    after the delayed recognition. <q ab:speaker="Liddlefuran gatekeeper">We
    never expected to see you again! We thought you'd found the Edge or the
    Bucket of Winds.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Well, I'm back. Don't just stand there, let me
    in! Or I'll give you a fustigation that you'll never forget!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The door swung wide, and Paddelack stepped in to see a torch being held
    over his head and a stout man scrutinizing his face. <q
    ab:speaker="Liddlefuran gatekeeper">Paddelack, Returned, you look pretty
    much as you were.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What did you expect, that I'd turned into a
    Gostum? Well, come on, get me something hot to drink—scalding, mind
    you. I'm more dead than alive at the moment…One thing more: get the
    nestrexam together.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Soon Paddelack was standing, still in his parka and with a hot drink cupped
    in his hands, in the middle of the nestrexam's ancient assembly room, the
    largest of the communal rooms that dated from the age of the Polkraitz
    themselves. He addressed the large crowd that had gathered, briefly
    retelling what had happened since he and Pike had returned for <em>Number
    Two</em>. His face was still dirty and scarred from his trek over forty
    impossible kilometers during the most impossible part of the Patra-Bannk,
    and the merriment that he had feigned upon his miraculous arrival had
    vanished completely and absolutely.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Soon,</q> he said, <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">the
    Gostum will be arriving at our gate. They will try to enlist you in a war
    they are planning against Triesk—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Liddlefuran">Triesk?</q> shouted a voice buried in the
    crowd.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Certainly you have heard of Triesk, the ancient
    Polkraitz city of the north.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Liddlefuran">Ah, yes. It is far away, isn't it? Too far away
    to have a war against.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">No,</q> Paddelack replied with a shake of his
    head. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">The Gostum not only have a way of getting
    there but have the help of the Alien, Pike.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Vardyen, one of the old leaders of the Liddlefurans, stepped forward. He
    had a square jaw and tufted gray hair. <q ab:speaker="Vardyen">The same
    Polkraitz is Returned on the Golun-Patra? The same who cleared the path and
    escaped the Gostum fortress and visited the forbidden city across the
    ocean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">The same,</q> Paddelack reluctantly admitted.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Vardyen">Hmm, a man worth heeding, one would think,
    Paddelack. He is our friend.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">No. You cannot help him in this war.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Vardyen thought a moment. <q ab:speaker="Vardyen">I think you have not told
    us the cause.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">The Gostum think there are rockets at Triesk to
    take us all from Patra-Bannk, and they believe that Pike will show us how
    to use them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Vardyen">If Pike is giving his aid in their quest, then he
    must believe them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">But there is no definite proof, just some spy's
    word. You will all be killed. It is pointless, senseless, don't you
    understand?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Vardyen scratched his head. <q ab:speaker="Vardyen">And what happens when
    the Gostum come knocking at our door? What do you expect us to do, then? To
    fight with them or against them, Paddelack Wise One, we are dead either
    way.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack was silenced and sat down. After a few minutes he stood up
    again. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I have a hunch. Let us reconvene after
    I've checked it out. Do you agree?</q> Vardyen nodded and Paddelack walked
    out of the room. At the door he was accosted by his little friend Mith. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Come on, Mith,</q> he said, taking the boy's
    hand. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Let's see what we can find.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Mith and Paddelack searched for so many telclads on end that it was closer
    to a beclad. Other than finding another way out of Massarat, Paddelack did
    not know what he had expected to uncover. They passed systematically
    through the communal rooms, the sleeping quarters, the workshops, the
    furnace rooms, all of which were familiar to Paddelack. They saw nothing,
    and no one could report any exit. They continued downward. An old wooden
    ladder marked the lowest point at which Paddelack had ever been, yet there
    was still more to Massarat. The air was musky, and the slightest sound
    caused Paddelack and Mith to turn around, startled.
  </p>

  <p>
    After a beclad of fruitless searching, Paddelack was still convinced that
    there must be another way out of Massarat so that they could escape the
    Gostum if need be. When he finally found the exit, it was not what he had
    expected. The chamber was piled with litter, so old and rotted that it was
    half dust. The floor was strewn with loose rock, blown from the walls
    carved by the Polkraitz. A small furry animal scurried out from beneath the
    trash pile, and he kicked at it. It disappeared under a cracked slab and he
    pushed the cleaved pieces aside. Mith knelt with the lantern as Paddelack
    ran his finger around a hole whose existence, like most things in the
    world, seemed to have been forgotten at some point in the last
    millennium. They found concentric ridges of melted and rehardened metal,
    the kind of layers formed when one tries to cut through a piece of iron
    with a blowtorch whose flame isn't strong enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Someone worked very hard to get through this,</q>
    Paddelack muttered as he dropped a piece of rock into the hole. It
    clattered not far below. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I'm going down. Get me a
    long rope, Mith.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Soon they had a rope fastened to a solid support, and Paddelack lowered
    himself through the hole. Five meters down, no more, he stopped, toes
    touching bottom followed by heels.
  </p>

  <p>
    He passed the lantern around. Above his head were four giant, flat
    hexagons. By his feet were four more. Connecting the top set to the bottom
    were thin rods on the perimeters of the hexagons, surely not strong enough
    to support what was above. As he neared one of the plates, the iron
    medallion that he had always worn was snatched from his neck and stuck fast
    to the hexagon. Paddelack tried hard to yank the medallion away, but it
    wouldn't bulge. He walked forward a few steps until he met a wall blocking
    his way, but he found he could circle around it until he met another. He
    continued in this way, around walls and under, until he met another space
    with more giant hexagons on floor and ceiling. It was like a giant maze, a
    honeycomb. A space opened at his feet and he could see a wall below, as
    well as another unit of the construction.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Get me some paint!</q> he yelled up to Mith, his
    crabby tenor resonating down the honeycombs. It was a telclad before he had
    the paint in his hands and then marked his location. Mith held the rope as
    Paddelack dropped down to the lower level. Still another level down and
    several honeycombs away, Paddelack found a tube which sloped downward at a
    shallow angle. As always when confronted with a gateway, he did not
    hesitate. He jumped in and slid down, spiraling around with short pushes of
    his hands. If the tunnel was in actuality made for a wheeled device, it
    nonetheless made a serviceable sliding board.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the bottom he emerged onto a wide concourse. He sighed. This time there
    was a room nearby. At least it had a door in it and sat in the middle of
    the otherwise empty concourse. Inside it was light. Naturally? At his feet
    was—nothing. He shot back to the door. Then he realized how stupid he was
    being; obviously, since he hadn't fallen through, the floor was
    solid. Below, spaced about the edge of the floor, beyond the <q>glass</q>
    were seven or eight giant cylinders, each several meters long, pointing
    down into the blackness.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack sat on the nonexistent floor and sighed again. At first he had
    though that finding the hole under Massarat was the sheerest of luck, one
    chance in a million. But then, for twenty years he had assumed that the
    planet might be some kind of shell, and in that case, the shell had to be
    beneath everything, and so the fact that it was indeed below Massarat
    should have come as no surprise.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, he still faced another problem. Last Bannk at Daryephna, Pike had
    done his best to convince him that they had not come through the shell,
    that if the planet was a shell, it was a very thick one. Paddelack's only
    alternative—improbable as it seemed—had been that the planet was somehow
    natural. But now, Paddelack decided, he had just come through the shell. He
    had seen the inner structure itself. He <em>was</em> underneath now, except
    for this thin floor. And there <em>was</em> still gravity, more than one
    Two-Bit gravity, much too much for even a planet-sized floor to produce. So
    his initial reaction had been, after all, correct: the planet was not a
    shell ten thousand kilometers thick.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack rose to his feet and readied himself for the long climb up the
    tube. As he left the clear floor and circular room, he glanced over his
    shoulder at the blackness below his feet. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Something is down there,</q> he said aloud, <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">And it's mighty big. Maybe that's where all the
    people are.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Commander,</q> an angry Karrxlyn said to Pike a
    beclad later, <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">we have been to Massarat to request
    aid from the Liddlefurans, but they refuse to come out of hiding. What
    should be done?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Wait for them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">In the wind and cold?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Do it! We will starve them out. No need to use
    force. In the meantime, I want to go to Triesk to deliver an ultimatum.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Do you think it is a good idea? Triesk is a
    dangerous place for Gostum. Wait at least until we hear from the spy, a
    Trieskan who is to meet one of our men within the beclad.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">All right. Has word been passed to the north to begin
    the search for new recruits?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">It is being done now.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Good. Send out parties from Pant, Sect, all the other
    places. Do it quickly before the Bannk gets hot. We'll need everybody we
    can get. Now, I want to see the stala myself, as soon as possible.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You will not desert us, Commander, I trust.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The statement was unexpected. Pike paused and put his hand on Karrxlyn's
    shoulder. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Never doubt me, or you will regret it. Your
    cause is mine. I will save the Gostum from Patra-Bannk, get the ships, and
    teach you how to use them. I am Commander, am I not? Yes, I am
    Commander. However, I do want to see the stala. I have my own work to
    do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn smiled but with a hint of doubt. <q
    ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Good. Then I suggest you wait out the beclad; the
    winds will have quieted a bit and the trip will be slightly
    easier. Effrulyn can take you. He does little enough around here.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Pike and his escort were almost upon the stala before he realized that they
    had arrived at their destination. He hopped off the kneeling grask,
    wondering what such a thing was doing in the middle of an orange desert,
    surrounded by walkways that led off to nowhere. What could the Polkraitz
    have had in mind by putting it there?
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside, he was only half surprised at what he found. Effrulyn walked up
    behind him and pointed out two spots on the map.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Because of the Polkraitz chart, many believe the
    lower point is Konndjlan and the upper is Triesk, and that of Pant in
    between. I am skeptical.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike eyed the two dots, separated on this map by a ruler's length, but
    still one hundred thousand kilometers apart. <q ab:speaker="Pike">How come
    you are skeptical?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">One sees a point, one presses a bar, one emerges
    elsewhere. The identification of the Elsewhere is nontrivial. Does it
    correspond to a dot? How does one know? How does one know whether he is
    north or south or east or west? By the sun only, if one chooses to believe
    the world is bent. I can tell you which bar to press to get to Triesk; that
    one is right here, but as to exactly which dot represents Triesk, if any,
    that is another story. Again, because of the old chart, Triesk is a
    well-behaved case; others are singularly pathological.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike nodded as he saw Effrulyn's finger point to the Triesk bar. His hand
    wavered above it, undecided.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I take it you have been warned against going to
    Triesk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, I won't,</q> Pike said absently. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">But  must go elsewhere…to a place called Neberdjer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I know of no such place.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">This bar, here.</q> How Pike knew this, he wasn't
    sure.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Are you certain?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes. The word is in my head. I don't know why. I think
    the secret of the metallic hydrogen may be there. I must go and see.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">The Fear is present at most of these Elsewheres,
    that one in particular. We never go there under any circumstances.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike surveyed the rows of bars. <q ab:speaker="Pike">There aren't many
    places to go from here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn nodded. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">And I have been told that most of
    these bars do nothing at all.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Well, then, the choice is clear.</q> He touched the
    Neberdjer bar and a door on his left slid open. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Will
    you come?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn scowled. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I have more important things to
    do. If you will excuse me, I must get back to my lucubrations.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Then I will go alone. Get me my pack.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn did so. Pike checked everything, shouldered the pack, and walked
    into the waiting room. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I will be back within several
    beclads at the latest. Until then, I hope your lucubrations prove
    fruitful…</q> The door slid shut and he disappeared.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Twenty-Two</div>The Road to
  Cathay</h2>

  <blockquote ab:speaker="Stringer">
    <p>
      <strong>Entry 1:</strong> Alhane wanted me to keep a journal. What do I say
      to a journal? I guess I will talk about the trip. Even that seems
      pointless. What is done is done. No one will ever know or care. So why
      write about it?
    </p>

    <p>
      Patra-Bannk is made for soaring, even though the wind is still rough, so
      I must be on my guard. We had little trouble reaching Glintz, where I am
      now. The main thing is to guess how far inland the air starts rising and
      find the waves.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Glintz everyone recognized me as an Alien immediately. Even if I hide
      my hands with only ten fingers, this Bannk everyone's skin is getting
      dark and scaly, and there is no disguise I will always talk like an
      Alien. My voice isn't flexible enough to make all the Tjenen sounds
      correctly. This problem is biological.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taljen doesn't want to talk to me. I think she still believes I am
      Polkraitz. Otherwise I am in high spirits and am sure the trip will
      succeed. One thing I forgot to tell Taljen: the last twenty thousand
      kilometers on my map showed no villages. Either we fly that gap in one
      hop or we wait till next Bannk and sail by boat.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote ab:speaker="Taljen">
    <p>
      <strong>Dear Alhane:</strong> I have also decided to keep a journal and
      address it to you. I am terribly frightened, frightened out of my wits. I
      have left my home, my friends, all that has made me feel safe and
      wanted. Now I am flying south in a mechanical bird that at times seems as
      if it could be snapped in two by an angry wind, flying south with an
      Alien who could easily have come here to destroy us all. I want to
      believe he is to be trusted, but he seems to haunt me, enjoying his
      ambiguity. I am ripped apart. Why am I doing this to myself? Is it to
      prove your theory wrong? Is it to prove that Ta-tjenen is indeed the
      might Ta-tjenen I had always thought? I am compelled to go with
      Stringer. But I need him to hold me, to give me shelter, and he so rarely
      does. I admire his ability to stand alone. I wish we could stand
      together. Oh, Alhane, Time Keeper, I do not want to vanish off the Edge
      of the World. I pray that your shadows are right; I pray that they are
      wrong.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The campfire was nearly invisible in the bright morning light, but the
    deceptive time did not prevent Stringer from being exhausted after the
    flight from Ta-tjenen. He wanted to collapse into sleep, but the men and
    women to Glintz gathered around and pumped him with questions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Glintz man">Do you mean you came all the way from Ta-tjenen
    in that solofar?</q> one of the men asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, we did, and will go much farther still.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Glintz man">How long did it take?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">A third of a beclad, perhaps. I'm not sure.</q>
    Stringer answered.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Glintz man 2">Surely that is a thief's tale,</q> another man
    offered.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Glintz man 3">We should build one ourselves and go to
    Ta-tjenen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Glintz man 4">Who wants to go to Ta-tjenen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The discussion was too lively for Stringer, and he kept tossing off sleep
    with a shake of the head. The man nearest him leaned over. <q
    ab:speaker="Fent">Come. You two can sleep in my house and rest.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The house was small and everything about it was highly ornate. The walls
    were covered with paintings, unframed, colors colliding head-on. The giant
    montage of nudes, abstractions, everyday scenes, was so complex that
    Stringer could not sort it out. Jugs of water sat on the floor, unglazed
    so they would sweat and thereby cool their contents, but nevertheless
    ringed with angular scrollwork from top to bottom. A bookshelf, too, with
    bound volumes, stood from floor to ceiling. Stringer squinted around him,
    never having seen anything like this in Ta-tjenen except for the Time
    Keeper's house.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fent">My grandfather lived here and painted those. He was
    also a great collector of books.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer's drowsiness lifted suddenly. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You know
    who your grandfather was and that he lived in this house?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The man, who was twice as old as Stringer, smiled. <q ab:speaker="Fent">Ah,
    you are from Ta-tjenen, that is right, even though you haven't enough
    fingers and your speech is spastic. Glintz was founded by those who didn't
    like the Parlztluzan and thus left Ta-tjenen. We have never used that
    system. And, as a result, you see that Glintz is much smaller than
    Ta-tjenen, or so I've been told. Of course, brief conjugal visits are
    sometimes necessary.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer didn't understand that, but was too tired to get into another
    discussion now. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What is your name?</q> he asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fent">Fent. Fent of Glintz, you can call me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">All right, I will.</q> Stringer took Taljen's arm
    and they were led into the next room. They slept very soundly. Stringer
    awoke to Taljen's embrace. She hugged him passionately, pulling his body
    closer to hers than ever before. He thought his back would break and he
    responded with eagerness. For a moment he forgot the time, the nebulous
    time on Patra-Bannk of which he was never certain, but which was always
    urging him on, pressing him southward.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aftersex, when they had gotten up and dressed, he said to Taljen, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm glad you aren't angry at me any more.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen hardly looked at him as she said matter-of-factly, <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">I think part of me was trying to kill you.</q> Stringer
    slumped back onto the floor and silently watched her walk into the
    wind-scattered sunlight.
  </p>

  <p>
    They had one more quick meal at Glintz. When the eating was done, Stringer
    said to Fent, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I can offer you little in return for
    your hospitality other than a tune on my rodoft.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fent">An excellent exchange!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer played. His fingers were one with the instrument; his libido
    manifested itself in the energy of the music. For another moment he forgot
    the time and the sun at his back.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end, Fent slapped his knees. <q ab:speaker="Fent">You are a master!
    But your tunes are not those of Ta-tjenen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I am not of Ta-tjenen, so my tunes are
    different.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fent">That you are not from Ta-tjenen is clear. Where are
    you from?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer liked Fent. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm not sure myself any
    more,</q> he said softly.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the way to the beach they passed through the town. Nestled in the woods,
    all the houses were lively and gaily painted. Stringer thought that
    reckless in the face of the Bannk, the Killer Bannk; reds and blues
    absorbed heat.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fent">Don't worry,</q> said Fent. <q ab:speaker="Fent">As
    the Bannk wears on, we put the white sheet out. But a dreary white city is
    not a crumb snatcher's price to pay to lower the temperature a handful of
    degrees.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You're right,</q> Stringer agreed. By this time
    they were at the sailplane, and Fent helped Stringer and Taljen into the
    cockpit. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I hope to see you again,</q> Stringer
    said, at once realizing the hopelessness of the remark.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fent">Yes, we will see each other, Stringer Who Is from
    Ta-tjenen but Not.</q> Stringer knew that Fent had no conception of what
    lay ahead for him and Taljen, if that were something possible to conceive
    at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    Boats by the hundreds had been pulled up on the beach from the still
    largely frozen ocean. Now they were cleared out of the way to make a runway
    for the sailplane. Men who had been fishing out on the ice came to watch
    the launch, and the beach was soon lined with thousands of spectators. The
    grask team had been waiting for Stringer's final command, and now, after
    last-minute instructions, he gave it to them. In a moment they were
    airborne. Stringer took a turn around the town in a farewell salute and
    soared southward.
  </p>

  <p>
    They watched the ice far below break up as the Bannk grew older. Small
    puffy clouds were beginning to form inland, and the prevailing winds were
    shifting south.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Always keep an eye on the clouds,</q> Stringer
    explained to Taljen. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">They are our only markers for
    finding rising air. And watch the hills. We'll ride the air currents over
    the hills. We need all the help we can get.</q> Taljen remained
    silent. Finally Stringer said, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Tell me, Glintz
    does not have the Parlztluzan; why do you have it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Or why don't they have it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Taljen, I'd be interested to know either way. The
    <q>Changing of Houses</q> is the strangest thing I've ever heard of.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You don't have it, either?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Of course not.</q> Stringer did not wait for the
    silence this time. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But if you know the reason for
    its existence, I'd like you to tell me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen began slowly. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I am told that it was organized
    after the war against the Gostum when the Polkraitz left. The population
    was decimated, and this would help restore it. Those who disagreed went to
    Glintz. You see that Glintz is much smaller than Ta-tjenen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer mulled that over for a while. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't see
    what difference it can make whether or not you rotate mates, as far as the
    number of children produced.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">All right, then, I will explain it to you as if you
    were a child. You know that Ta-tjenen runs on clocks—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">—or ignores them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Everything runs on clocks, not necessarily
    mechanical. Everything has its own cycle. Some cycles are long, like the
    fertility cycles of males and females. In order to produce children, both
    clocks must be on, both cycles must be matched. That does not happen very
    often if mates are not switched. The clocks must be synchronized at the
    Parlztluzan.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Men have breeding cycle?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Of course. Don't you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">We are always <q>on.</q></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">So, you see,</q> Taljen said, ignoring the last
    remark, <q ab:speaker="Taljen">after a war a Parlztluzan is a good thing to
    institute.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Is it a good thing to keep?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">With the mortality rate at Ta-tjenen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Glintz does without it.</q> They merely used
    <q>brief conjugal visits</q> but kept permanent parents, and look at the
    difference between Ta-tjenen and Glintz. But without one method or the
    other, Patra-Bannk, pitted against the peculiar biology of these people,
    would surely bring the species to a dead end. How they had evolved into
    such a cul-de-sac without already being extinct was beyond Stringer. Their
    original world must have been very kind.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen continued, interrupting Stringer's thoughts. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">And, Stringer, judging from the way you act, I wonder
    if your society should institute it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Perhaps.</q>
  </p>

  <blockquote ab:speaker="Stringer">

      I do not understand that very strange thing she said to me at Glintz,

    </p>

      something tells me I won't. The sun is getting high and I want to

  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Godrhan was not right on the coast, and after landing, Stringer and Taljen
    walked into the town unescorted. The first thing Stringer saw, lying level
    with the ground, was a small plaza, like that of Ta-tjenen but half as
    large. On the plaza wall a tall pole, three or four times the height of a
    man, supported on all sides by guy lines, and with a thin wire sticking up
    from the top. Many arms projected radially from the pole with weights
    hanging from their tips: plumb bobs, Stringer thought. A closer inspection
    also revealed levels mounted around the pole. Dirt blew up around it in the
    strong wind, forming a large cloud around the base.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">That's Alhane's!</q> Taljen exclaimed when she saw
    it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Godrhan woman">Did I hear someone mention Alhane?</q> a
    voice called from a nearby house. A woman, shorter than Taljen and heavier
    by more than a hair, jumped out of the doorway and ran up to them. She was
    wearing a sun suit. <q ab:speaker="Godrhan woman">Did you say the name of
    Alhane?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes,</q> Taljen answered.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Godrhan woman">Your accent is strange. From Ta-tjenen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You are right.</q> Taljen smiled. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">And I know Alhane well.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The fatter woman grinned. <q ab:speaker="Godrhan woman">Then you must come
    out of the sun and talk. Did Alhane arrive safely back in Ta-tjenen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Quite safe; I am sure he would thank you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Godrhan woman">And did he prove what he set out to
    prove?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">He thinks he did; others aren't so sure.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The other woman shook her head. <q ab:speaker="Godrhan woman">That would be
    strange indeed. I'm told by our scientists that, if true, Godrhan would be
    displaced from the Center.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen started and Stringer laughed, doubling over. His cowl, blowing
    because it was untied, wrapped itself around his face, and the three cloths
    tangled there.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">How can Godrhan be the Center if Ta-tjenen is?</q>
    Taljen asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Godrhan woman">The reason Godrhan was founded was because
    the founders decided that Ta-tjenen was not the Center after all and that
    the Tjenens were mistaken to think so.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">But Ta-tjenen <em>means</em> <q>The Rising at the
    Center.</q></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Godrhan woman">Words!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen sighed and the wind whistled. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I am not sure
    who is correct, but someone must be wrong.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer untangled his cowl and interrupted. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We
    have been traveling a long time without a sleep. Do you have any food you
    could offer us and a place to hide from the sun?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Godrhan woman">Of course,</q> the woman replied. <q
    ab:speaker="Godrhan woman">Come with me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer grabbed his rodoft and followed her.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Stringer had his eyes riveted on the map viewer as he stood by
    <em>Nothing,</em> waiting to depart. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The next town
    is far,</q> he said, looking up at Taljen. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">farther
    than we have come already. My map says about four thousand kilometers. And we
    must get there. Are you well rested?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Just as he looked up, Taljen hid something behind her back.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What have you got there?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Nothing for your eyes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Come on,</q> Stringer said, making a playful dive
    at the piece of paper. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What have we here?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen smiled meekly as she released the paper. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I'm
    scared.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer took the parchment and looked at it. It was a small copy of the
    map from the great meeting tent which had Ta-tjenen in the Center and
    Godrhan at the bottom. The collector of winds was not far, according to the
    map.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was about to rip up the chart but instead gave it back to
    Taljen. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Look at my map,</q> he said, and Taljen
    did. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We will see who is right, I think. If you
    die, remember, I am only in the next seat and will join you shortly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Okay,</q> Taljen said.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer grinned at her simple Bitter. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Okay.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    For the first time this Bannk, Stringer wiped the sweat off his brow. Then
    he put on his cowl, checking his salt and water flasks, and entered the
    sailplane. The first teclad of this Killer Bannk was more than half gone,
    and then still had a long way to go.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So, you see,</q> said Stringer when they had flown
    another one thousand kilometers or more, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">your map
    is wrong and we have not been collected with the winds, nor have we fallen
    off the Edge of the World.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen hesitated before speaking. She folded the map on which she had kept
    a watchful eye and placed it in her bag among her few belongings. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">It seems that you may be right, Stringer,</q> she said
    slowly. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">If the world has an edge, it is not
    here. Patra-Bannk looks to be larger than I expected.</q> She wiped a tear
    from her eye. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Are you satisfied?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Me? What good does it do me? Perhaps you now see
    that Ta-tjenen may not be the Center.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Perhaps.</q>
  </p>

  <blockquote ab:speaker="Stringer">
    <p>
      <strong>Entry 14:</strong> The Bannk is totally with us. The sun is
      already higher than it was last Bannk and has turned from friend to
      enemy. It is very hot, hotter than a desert on Two-Bit, but swamped in
      humidity. Clouds are beginning to diffuse the sun and whiten the sky. But
      so far, we have been able to reach each village in one hop from the
      last. What luck! We are losing weight. Food on this planet is not
      plentiful. Shade is not plentiful, either. The pod-tree forest ended long
      ago.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most villages are only specks on my map and hardly have any contact with
      the others. None have any idea that their own planet is round. Sometimes
      I think everybody here is stupid. At least none but Ta-tjenen and Godrhan
      think that their village is the Center.
    </p>

    <p>
      My hands are nothing but calluses from holding the stick for telclads and
      dragging <em>Nothing</em> around after we land. Taljen's skin is dark and
      leathery this Bannk. She is unrecognizable from last. She is still
      beautiful, but it is a new kind of beauty, a beauty for surviving, not for
      watching. I think if she had looked this way when we first met, I would
      have thought her ugly, half reptile. Maybe my tastes have changed. My own
      skin used to be a dull gray-green; now it is splotched over with brown
      and black. Taljen is better at keeping time than I am, but both of us are
      losing track of how long we have been gone.

  <blockquote ab:speaker="Taljen">

      <strong>Alhane:</strong> Where we are, I don't know, nor could I conceive

      are but minute specks on Stringer's map, but, to them, Ta-tjenen is only a
      name, far away. When I try to tell the people of the wonders of their
      parent city, they only shrug. The Parlztluzan is almost an oddity; some
      towns use it and others do not. Nothing is constant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stringer's rodoft sees us through. We have nothing to pay our hosts but
      music, and it is gratefully accepted. Stringer is wonderful when he plays
      his rodoft. He said he took it up just for diversion, but you can see
      that he speaks to it as he plays. His playing is not quite as forceful as
      it used to be but is richer and means more to me.

  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I think you have a pretty planet,</q> Stringer
    said as he leaned back, tuned his rodoft, and looked out over the misty
    blue ocean.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen, in front of him, banked the plane and shook her head. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">No Tjenen would ever agree to that, my Alien.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer laughed and plucked a chord. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That's
    because you've never had a chance to enjoy it. If you could, then you would
    realize it is very pretty and unspoiled compared with mine.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What is your planet like?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Small, infinitesimally small compared with this
    one. My planet would disappear if it were spread out on this one. And it's
    mostly people. It's very crowded, so not one gets too upset if anyone is
    killed in a fight—big or little. There are lots of fights; there are no
    nestrexas. Like Alhane, everyone grows up with a permanent family. Sometimes
    there is a big war or famine and the population goes down a little. Then it
    goes up again, then down again. I think sooner or later something will have
    to give. We colonized a few sister worlds in our solar system but that
    didn't help much. They're as crowded as Two-Bit now. Then we built ships
    like the one that brought us here. Everyone is so eager to have them that
    the government spends a lot of time trying to make sure they're used
    right. But the government is a flop. I'm not sure why the ships were built
    at all, or why there is such a big fuss about them. They're so expensive
    that only the biggest businesses can afford them. They can't bring back
    much. They can't carry many people. The few colonies that they've
    established on nearby planets are small. It's too expensive to bring back
    what little they make and soon, I guess, those worlds will be crowded
    too. Maybe now that we're discovered Patra-Bannk everyone will come
    here. That will solve the problem.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">There is a lot to it, I see.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, twenty-five hundred Two-Bits' worth, at
    least. I wish the scenery would change a little though. You'd think we've
    gone nowhere instead of more than twelve thousand kilometers, two
    continents' worth of distance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You may have your wish soon. Look ahead.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer did and saw huge mountains rearing in the distance, the same he
    had seen on the northward journey. It was difficult to say how far away
    they were. Guessing on any planet was hazardous; on Patra-Bannk
    impossible.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">And what of you, Stringer?</q> Taljen asked
    suddenly. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You have told me of your world but have
    never said anything of your own life.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer sighed and paused. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What is a life? I
    don't know.…Jumbled memories of people and places best left
    forgotten. Jumbled fragments of might-have-beens and whiffs of dreams
    destroyed. There are too many dark corners, occasionally illuminated by a
    stranger who, for a time, becomes a friend, until random events, trapdoors,
    yank you down different corridors of the maze. It is a maze of dead ends
    and broken paths where each event, each turning point, is like the murder
    of an unborn self, until you are finally left with but one path to follow
    and have become what you were never meant to be.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    After a long silence Taljen spoke. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You've never said
    anything like that before.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It is difficult to always sound like yourself,</q>
    Stringer chuckled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I wouldn't hold your breath for
    more. My life is just a life, nothing else.</q>

  <h2><div>Chapter Twenty-Three</div>So Near and Yet
  So Far</h2>

  <p>
    Pike did not know where he was; he could barely think about where he
    was. The pain was terrible. it climbed up from the medulla and forced its
    way into the upper brain like a barbed ice pick, tearing out the inside of
    his head. Whatever nerves had once linked his motor center to his limbs
    were now disconnected. Nothing worked. If he could look through his eyes,
    he might find himself crumpled in a heap, thrown into some corner. Had it
    been a week? Five beclads? A teclad? Pike didn't know and couldn't think
    about it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pain abated, and Pike struggled again to remember what had happened. He
    had reached Neberdjer. It was something like Daryephna, bigger—much—and
    disjointed, not one structure. But he had hardly noticed that while he
    walked to a predetermined destination. The four facing hyperbolas; yes, he
    remembered those. They must be above him now. Where was that?
  </p>

  <p>
    The pain again. Morse code with a sledgehammer: <em>dot dot
    blam</em>. Another ebb. Prickles here, there, everywhere. Why couldn't he
    be killed now and be done with it?
  </p>

  <p>
    The sounds cohered. First soft moans, plosives, maybe a little afterward or
    before. The first words were clumsy, random, broken, faulty
    intonation. Quickly they gained fidelity, spoken as if by a human. The rate
    increased, words said as fast as a blur until Pike's vocabulary was
    exhausted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometime later came the first sentence in perfect Bitter: <q
    ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Tell me, what is it like to die? Please answer. I
    see you are concerned with death. I want it explained to me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Who are you?</q> Pike managed to ask. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">What have you been doing to me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I am Neberdjer. I have been trying to talk to
    you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What do you want with me? Why am I being held
    here?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I have been trying to talk to you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You have been trying to kill me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I don't understand what that means. Do you mean I
    have been trying to terminate your life functions?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">No,</q> came the calm reply. <q
    ab:speaker="Neberdjer" class="no-close-quote">That isn't true at all. I
    need your help. Recently I have become conscious, aware that I
    exist. Previously I may have been thinking but was not conscious of it. A
    difficult concept. I am not sure. More recently I have discovered the
    existence of Aliens. I need your help. Therefore, I have been trying to
    communicate with you. It is difficult. The concept of someone else is even
    more difficult than the concept of self, but once that is understood, the
    possibility of communication follows immediately. To construct the sentence
    <q>I am Neberdjer</q> was one of the most taxing sentences of my
    life. Previously <q>I</q> and <q>Neberdjer</q> were one, indistinguishable
    in meaning. The discovery of an independent being necessitated proposing a
    <q>not-Neberdjer,</q> a <q>not-I</q>: a <q>you.</q> Assuming the
    <q>yous</q> are independently aware of their own existence, or at least
    quasi-independent, the I-equals-Neberdjer equality is not
    universal. Neberdjer is discovered not to be the only <q>I</q>: a new word
    is needed to place in opposition to <q>I</q>: <q>you.</q> And a word is
    needed to place in opposition to <q>you</q>: <q>I</q> in your language. I
    will use that. I am Neberdjer. You are not Neberdjer. The entire experience
    raises the question of whether the concept of self can truly evolve without
    the concept of others.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
     <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">You call yourself humans, correct? You humans
     are difficult to talk to. Of course, I say that relatively speaking, as I
     have rarely talked to anyone before. Why do you think I am trying to hurt
     you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You are hurting me!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Hurt? The meaning I have learned from you
    connotes nothing to me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I cannot move, I cannot function, I hurt. Surely you
    must see that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">You, Pike, have been a big problem. When I first
    met you, you did not speak Barbalan's language, which I had so
    painstakingly learned, so I could not speak to you in the simple manner I
    had developed with her. But I needed to get a message to you. At best, it
    has been tedious to have to follow individual nerve impulses, trace
    synaptic connections, and manipulate the fundamental chemical and physical
    reactions that produce words and phrases in your mind. All this I endured
    for a time with Barbalan, until I learned to speak with her. Then you came
    along. Not only were you ignorant of her language—forcing me to repeat the
    entire process—but you insisted on running away, so I was obliged to do it
    in a hurry, using an extra large portion of my resources, perhaps a
    millionth of one percent. The results are clearly dubious. Now I have been
    trying to learn your native language more systematically because it has a
    larger vocabulary than the Gostum language. And, in addition, I still seem
    to be causing you pain. I will reduce the energy levels. Would you like
    some food?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike now remembered that he had recently eaten, that this Neberdjer had
    been feeding him. The pain lifted. Pike blinked his eyes and shook his
    head. <q ab:speaker="Pike">You will let me go! I am the Polkraitz
    Returned. I am Commander of the Gostum forces and I demand that you let me
    go!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I need your help; I have told you that
    already. The stability control mechanism—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">What?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Is that not why you have come?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No. I have come for the metallic-hydrogen
    manufacturing facility.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">That is of no importance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">It is!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">The stability control, the centering—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">The hydrogen,</q> Pike insisted as much as he
    could. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Show me the facility, and I will help you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">No,</q> came the reply all but
    instantaneously. <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I can't.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Why not?</q> Pike found that since the pain had
    abated, he could move.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">After probing your memories, I do not think you
    will like the experience. In fact, you won't survive if you go through with
    it. I see you are afraid of death, the termination of life functions—a
    strange concept. I have determined from your physical makeup that you would
    not survive the trip to the facility. If you would like me to kill you by
    taking you there, I would be willing to do so without hesitation, except
    for the fact that you would not then—if I understand your death
    correctly—be available for the repair of the stability control
    mechanism. Therefore, I cannot take you to the facility. The reasoning is
    clear.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">So you lied to me. You probably don't even know where
    the facility is. I've had enough of this.</q> Pike jumped up and began
    walking briskly up the stairs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Where are you going? I need you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike tried to suppress his thoughts.<q ab:speaker="Pike">You have lied to
    me and have tried to kill me! You have tried to prevent me from getting the
    secret! I will invade Triesk and find it there. I don't need you!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Triesk? Why are you invading Triesk?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">This is the Golun-Patra and I must have the secret of
    Triesk. I am in Command, the Polkraitz Returned.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I did not know that the Polkraitz were back. That
    is interesting.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike did not stop his running until he found the stala, blocks away. He
    gasped for air as he reached it, lying open under a domed sky with its map
    central and doors surrounding it at the plaza's perimeter. He slammed his
    fist on the bar that he knew would take him to Konndjlan and dove past the
    door as it opened for him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I'll see to you yet, Neberdjer!</q> he shouted as the
    door slid shut behind him. <q ab:speaker="Pike">You will pay for this! I
    will not leave Patra-Bannk a failure. Then you will pay. Wait and see!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The sand was burning when Pike emerged at Konndjlan. The guard was there,
    as always, ready to take him up. The heat was unbearable on this desert and
    would kill them very quickly without extreme precautions. He'd have to do
    something about that. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Give me a report,</q> he said to
    the escort.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard">The new recruits are arriving by bits and
    pieces. You can see some ahead now. We are housing them on the plateau at
    Massarat because the Liddlefurans have still not come out of hiding.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike looked up. <q ab:speaker="Pike">How long have I been gone?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard">The better part of a teclad, Commander. We
    were about to give you up for lost.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">So was I. Give me some water.</q> The escort
    unstrapped his leathern flask and Pike drank heavily. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">What about the ultimatum to Triesk?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard">Refused, I have been told. The spy confirms
    the rocket reports.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Indeed.</q> Pike took another drink as the grask loped
    on, orange sand flying behind its hooves and the Massarat mountains
    unforgivingly shedding their shadows in the wrong direction. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">We will go to Triesk. Neberdjer will see that the
    Polkraitz cannot be stopped.</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Twenty-Four</div>Two
  Epiphanies</h2>

  <blockquote ab:speaker="Stringer">
    <p>
      <strong>Entry 22:</strong> The sun is high. I can't bear to look at it,
      even though this murky haze does its best to blot out the light. Clouds
      are few, and those are very high in the air, as high as the sun, it
      seems. Mostly it is just this stultifying haze. My hands are nearly black
      and carved from heat and wind, except where the red shows through from
      bruises and infections. Taljen tells me my hair is lighter than it was,
      bleached by that evil light. Every few telclads I peel off newly burned
      skin, always unexpected because of the diffuse sunlight. Always it seems
      to get hotter and wetter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I know why they call this the Killer Bannk. No one greets us any more
      when we land. We must seek out help from villagers hiding in their buried
      houses or caves. There is no activity this Bannk. Everyone has fled from
      that bearer of life, the sun.
    </p>

    <p>
      The land is barren. Little vegetation and few animals present
      themselves. Only the strongest survive here. Most of the animals we catch
      for food are in a kind of hot-weather hibernation to preserve energy. I
      imagine Patra-Bannk must be much as it was millions of years ago,
      evolution slowed nearly to a halt by the fantastic temperature
      change. Better always subfreezing or always boiling than this hellish
      swing from one to the other.
    </p>

    <p>
      The beaches, even though locally of white sand, are hot. Rocks are too
      hot to touch. The air is stiflingly humid here on the way south. I always
      feel on the verge of nausea. Sometimes I think I can see steam boiling
      off the ocean at water's edge, although I wonder how the air can absorb
      any more water than it already has. I begin to wonder also how long we
      can survive. I have rarely felt so continually sick.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taljen urges me on, but even she grows weary of the journey. What point
      is there in it for her? She has nothing to gain by going, only exile from
      her beloved Ta-tjenen. I think I have fallen in love with her. For all
      her fear and superstition, she has shown herself to be a brave and good
      companion.
    </p>

    <p>
      If my writing is indecipherable, it is because we are in <em>Nothing</em>
      and my pen jitters because of the ride. We are nearing our next stop.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The sand sprayed up as <em>Nothing</em>'s wheel and skis touched the
    ground. The village, small from the air, was invisible from the
    ground. Stringer and Taljen jumped from the sailplane and off the hot
    sand. The walk to the town was a few kilometers over fern-moss and
    low-lying scruff. Their sole company was, of course, the sun, which did its
    best to convince the two that each step was three times its length in
    reality. Taljen kept close to the few trees that were tall enough to
    project shade, and scratched her itching suit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Only one man was visible outside the settlement, itself as barren as the
    surroundings, houses no more than caves set into the embankment. The lone
    man was hurrying to the cluster of dwellings with an adz thrown over his
    shoulder. He stopped when he noticed the two strangers but did not seem
    surprised at their presence.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="villager 2">So you too are going south,</q> he said in a
    dialect that Stringer strained to understand. <q ab:speaker="villager 2">I
    may go myself.</q> He offered Taljen his leather water flask.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen's own flask was empty and she accepted the offer. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Why is everyone going south?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The man walked around to a shaded spot and knelt, propping himself up on
    the handle of his adz. <q ab:speaker="villager 2">I see that you dialect is
    very strange, even stranger than that of the last people I saw who said
    they had come up from the south to get us. Something is afoot.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Can't you tell us what it is?</q> Stringer asked
    exasperatedly, moving into the shade and slumping down. He was very tired;
    he was almost dead.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="villager 2">There are rumors. No one is saying for sure, but
    it has been rumored that the Polkraitz are Returned and are readying to
    take us off this planet, as they so promised ages ago. The way south is
    magic and takes us beyond the World's Edge. Who knows what is going on? But
    if it will get us out of the sun, it's worth finding out.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer withered under Taljen's glare, hotter than the sun.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer, did you have something to do with
    this?</q> she asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">If I have been at Ta-tjenen or with you all the
    time, how could I have had anything to do with this?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Polkraitz can do many things, I suspect.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer threw up his arms. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">When will you believe
    me, Taljen? When?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Every time I start to trust you, my Stringer, you
    do something to make me doubt you. The arrival with your dead companion,
    the murder at the Festival, the exile. Now this. What am I to believe?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer didn't understand how Valyavar entered the argument, but he shot
    back, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, you're absolutely right. My companions
    and I are Polkraitz. We are Returned to take over Patra-Bannk. You are my
    first hostage and will be intermediary between us and the Tjenen slaves.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen stammered. Could she believe what she was hearing? For an answer she
    found only pain and confusion. She backed away from Stringer.
  </p>

  <p>
    They slept apart for the first time in a forgotten number of beclads.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You have only three grask in the entire
    village?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="villager">Yes, that is the case, truly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer bit his lip.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">That will have to do, don't you think?</q> Taljen
    interrupted.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, it will.</q> Stringer turned to the big
    man. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Can you bring them to the beach? We're about
    three or four kilometers away.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="villager">Except to fish, I never go that far myself,
    especially this Bannk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer took a gulp of water from the urn and splashed it over his
    face. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We have to launch our sailplane—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="villager">What?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How can I explain unless you come to the
    beach?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The big man stroked his rough chin. <q ab:speaker="villager">All right,
    we'll come.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    It took a long time for Stringer to explain to the small group what he
    wanted done. The first problem was to keep the villagers outdoors in heat
    that could easily have been over seventy or eighty degrees. The second
    problem was to convince them that the sailplane wasn't alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="village woman">Why can't it fly away by itself?</q> one of
    the women kept asking as she prodded the faded nose with her forefinger.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It needs your help to get it off the ground,</q>
    Stringer repeated for the dozenth time. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We will
    sit in it. Your grask must pull.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="village woman 2">Does it let you sit in it without
    squawking?</q> another asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="village woman 3">When a solofar squawks, the air shrieks for
    all around,</q> agreed a third.
  </p>

  <p>
    And so it went. Finally Stringer checked the ropes and the release hooks,
    made the man in charge repeat the instructions three times verbatim, and
    climbed into <em>Nothing</em>. He hoped the three grask, strong and fast as
    they were, would be enough. It was more than a hope; three grask
    <em>had</em> to be enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    He waved his arm and slid shut the hood. <em>Nothing</em> bumped along on
    the beach. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Faster!</q> he yelled.
  </p>

  <p>
    The grask drivers didn't hear correctly, if they heard at all. Stringer
    jumped out, angry.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You'd better let me explain,</q> Taljen said, and
    she did.
  </p>

  <p>
    This time <em>Nothing</em> barely cleared the rise down to the beach, but
    <q>barely</q> proved to be good enough. Stringer was glad to be away from
    that village.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Can you imagine,</q> he said as they soared down
    the coast, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">that I couldn't even convince them that
    this bird was artificial?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Did you expect to?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer cocked his head. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you mean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen banked the plane and took a few turns up. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Is
    it truly that hard for you to see? This sailplane is big like a solofar, is
    painted like a solofar; from a distance it could be a solofar, so to those
    villagers it is a solofar.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It doesn't look like a real bird to me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It did to me when I first saw it. But we are used to
    it now. We built it, know it all the way through, Stringer. But they have
    never seen an artificial bird. They have never even considered an
    artificial bird. Is it so hard for you to see that the first thing they
    would think is that <em>Nothing</em> was alive? A small solofar just like
    any other?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, I guess I can understand that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Good. How far is the next village?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer took out the viewer. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Far enough,
    especially with the fading wind. The ocean is heating; far from the
    terminator the winds aren't as strong. Our progress gets slower all the
    time.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What can be done?</q> Taljen shrugged. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">We have to keep going.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">For what? It has been so long. Pike and Hendig may
    be dead. Then what?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen answered after a long hesitation. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">If you feel
    that way, why did you come?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What else was there to do? Maybe it doesn't
    matter. At the next village we will probably only find two grask, and that
    will be the end of us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    This time Taljen did not answer at all.
  </p>

  <blockquote ab:speaker="Stringer">
    <p>
      <strong>Entry 25:</strong> It is just Mid-Bannk, and we are not halfway
      to our destination. It is getting hotter all the time, and I think we
      will all evaporate. I have just finished a thirty-kilometer walk. We
      mistakenly landed at a deserted village, but luckily the new settlement
      was nearby. I will have to convince the villagers to bring grask back to
      where I left Taljen. She was cheerful when I left her. I hope the heat
      hasn't killed her by the time I get back. If it weren't for her company,
      I don't know what I would do. Part of her seems to distrust me still. But
      I can complain; I've earned it.

    <p>
      People are going south from this village, too. Soon all the villages will
      be deserted and our incredible luck will end.

      My body feels worse than it has ever felt before. I am bruised, my
      clothing is ripped, my hands are pulpy. There is no spring left in my
      movements. My tiredness is not the kind that leaves you after a long
      sleep, but that which follows you around everywhere you go. It is almost
      time to give up. What a fool I was to ever think this journey was
      feasible. Three times around Two-Bit in a glider was what we were asking
      of ourselves and this contraption. An idiot's dream.

      be back in comfortable Ta-tjenen. The trip is killing us, though my skin
      is thick this Bannk, and I would give anything to see friends again, to
      dance, to work my shifts. But now I am not all Tjenen any more. I have
      seen much that confuses me. I am suspended between two worlds. More than
      ever I am ripped apart and do not know which way I will go. Wish me luck.

  <p>
    The cockpit was steaming, but Stringer did not pull back the canopy because
    the airflow would be disturbed and kilometers lost. The ground looked as it
    had for the last teclads, the ocean looked the same. Everything looked the
    same. Why couldn't this planet be bigger for all its size? Now, Stringer
    thought, everything has decided to merge and get blurry. I must be sleepy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen felt the plane drop suddenly and then regain its altitude. She
    looked closely at Stringer but said nothing. When it happened a second
    time, she lightly took hold of her duplicate controls. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Are you all right, Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, all right.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    But a few minutes later, he doubled over and retched, then collapsed
    completely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen bit her lip and grabbed the controls. She waited a moment for
    Stringer to get up, but he didn't. They were hundreds of kilometers from
    anywhere. She couldn't land now, but she must. Stringer remained
    motionless. Taljen squeezed her hands tightly around the stick, trying to
    decide what to do. She landed. The right wing snapped off at the tip as it
    collided with a large rock and jerked to a halt. Taljen's head slammed
    against the front seat and she momentarily blacked out. As soon as she came
    to, she was out of the plane.
  </p>

  <p>
    Quickly she pitched the tent under a giant bush and laid Stringer in
    it. Within telclads his skin began to redden and gray sores appeared over
    his body. She kept him as cool as she could, but in his delirium he
    struggled and twisted and only increased the fever. Taljen though he would
    surely die, but by the second beclad the sores had faded and Stringer was
    quiet. She had not slept at all. Finally he awoke and sat up. Taljen
    unstoppered her flask and gave him what little water remained.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer drank slowly and coughed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How long?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">About two beclads. Who can tell exactly?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer handed back the water flask. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Have you
    begun evaporating some sea water?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen nodded.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Where are we?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I don't know, Stringer, I don't know. Certainly far
    from any place, and with a broken wing on our bird.</q> Taljen brushed away
    her tears. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">The sun is doing its best to kill us. I
    am weak and you are weaker still. It is too hot to remain alive for long
    here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Don't cry,</q> Stringer said, reaching out for
    her. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You did what you had to do. I appreciate
    that. You know I love you for it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen smiled. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes, I know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you love me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen took his hand and laughed a little, tossing back her faded hair. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">It has taken time with you, my Alien. But yes, I think
    I do. Of course.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Something in the <q>of course</q> bothered Stringer. Had it been said too
    rapidly? Too offhandedly? He turned his head away. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't think I believe you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Oh, Stringer, now is not the time to talk of it. I
    am with you, glad to die with you—if that is what will happen to us—and
    will be glad to be able to say I have come, if the saying should ever
    happen. What else do you want?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    There was a long silence. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">If we live and I find my
    friends, will you stay with me? Or will you go back to Ta-tjenen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen laid down Stringer's hand. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">My love, the
    Parlztlu will be over sometime next Bannk, and I will have to get
    another. That is the way life is. Do you not understand that, Unfortunate
    Alien?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was beginning to shake, and his head hurt again. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">But I don't want to give you up. I want you with
    me…always.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Wh—?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Her voice sounded far away to Stringer; her face was a fuzzy
    vision. Although the sun was almost overhead, the darkness came, closing in
    on all sides. He let go.
  </p>

  <p>
    This time, Stringer was unconscious longer than before. Taljen prayed to
    any god that she could think of. She propped Stringer up and forced water
    down his throat, closed her ears to his screaming, and waited. She took the
    greenery off the bamboo shoots and covered the tent with them to help keep
    it cool. Nothing worked. She was beginning to feel sick, too. This was the
    Killer Bannk. No one ever went out except for the first and last teclads,
    and here she was, sitting under the sun, past Mid-Bannk, the hottest part
    of the Bannk. All she could do was wait, most likely wait to die with
    Stringer.
  </p>

  <p>
    But once again Stringer came to, as if a superhuman defiance brought him
    back to life. His body, already thin and worn from the journey, was more
    than emaciated. His cheeks were sunk into hollows and his green eyes stared
    into space, fogged and unseeing. He ate little, moved not at all. The gray
    splotches that covered his body gradually disappeared. Taljen, at first,
    did not understand why he spoke so few words, and then she remembered how
    he had been when she first knew him, almost a Patra-Bannk earlier.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he was strong enough, fed on food collected from plants and fish, he
    began to walk and finally dismantled the glider in order to be able to tow
    it. He hardly said a word the entire time, working with Taljen in an
    embarrassing silence that she did not know how to break.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the work was finished and the glider's wings were strapped to the
    fuselage and a simple sledge had been built to drag it, Stringer said, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">This planet is artificial.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen didn't even respond. It was as if the sentence had flown past her
    unnoticed. Stringer studied his face, watched her eyes, and thought to
    himself: <span ab:speaker="Stringer">No, you don't understand. What I said
    is totally outside any frame of reference that you have. You have
    discovered a world that is many time larger than you expected and which has
    no edge. But, like those villagers who thought that our glider was alive,
    to you an artificial planet does not even enter into your
    imagination.</span> Why it had entered into his own imagination, Stringer
    wasn't sure. But the conclusion now seemed logical, inevitable, the only
    one that explained everything, and he was convinced that if he had known
    more about what planets were like, he would have thought of it the moment
    he had arrived.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well,</q> he said in an overly distinct voice, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">let's go. We have a long walk ahead of us.</q>
  </p>

  <blockquote ab:speaker="Stringer">
    <p>
      <strong>Entry 27:</strong> Alhane, how blind I have been! Is it a matter
      of a language that I didn't learn properly? Is it obvious to all but me?
      Taljen claims to love me. She certainly has shown them more affection than
      I deserve. Yet, when the <q>houses must be changed,</q> she will be
      perfectly content to return to another. How could she be this way? How
      could I have expected anything else? Now I am beginning to perceive the
      cause of her ambivalence about the murder I committed when I first
      arrived at Ta-tjenen, her ambivalence about me, and yet her total
      devotion to the community as a whole. Taljen may love everyone or may
      love no one. I do not think I can tell which is the reality. Maybe
      Ta-tjenen has sorted out for itself my confusion. The Tjenens, perhaps,
      have done well by this outcome of peculiar biology—if it is the
      biology—if that causes it. As Taljen said, I might benefit from being a
      Tjenen. Who knows? If my entrance to Ta-tjenen had not started off so
      poorly, I might have found it a pleasant place to live. Ta-tjenen seems
      to be a city content with itself. Is it anything more? Perhaps you, who
      have a true love for your work, know the answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      But life is not all unfortunate, Time Keeper. I too have found the work
      to which I will devote myself. It came upon me in my sickness. Yes, a
      Patra-Bannk germ attacked my body through undefended channels. In my long
      delirium something opened up for me. It is like the feeling you get when
      you are about to wake up from a long night's sleep. (You've never had
      one, have you?) A picture, a solution to a bothersome problem, arises
      from your unconscious, and it must be caught or it sinks to the bottom of
      your brain again, lost until another lucky sleep gives you a second
      chance. There have been several occasions when I almost caught it: on my
      ship coming to our world, with Taljen in my shuttle, with her again last
      Patra. Now I have caught it, finally, after my pitifully slow mind put
      the pieces together. Now I have caught it, and although our journey seems
      hopeless, I must get south to Pike and his mysterious city. Because I am
      sure that is where the answers are.

  <h2><div>Chapter Twenty-Five</div>Swept Away</h2>

  <p>
    Pike remembered the first time he had ridden through the great cleft at
    Massarat after the escape from Konndjlan. That seemed a long time ago now,
    even though it was only last Bannk. The sun then had been about as high as
    it was now. But then the Bannk was on its downward slope, and now it was
    still beginning. Pike's shadow, atop his grask, was about the same length
    now as it had been then, but now the sun beat at his back instead of
    glaring in his eyes, and the shadow was cast in the opposite direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then the plateau had been deserted, all the people indoors or at the coast
    fishing for the Patra. Now the plain was covered with tents that rippled in
    the winds and people who wrinkled in the heat. Then his entry had gone all
    but unnoticed until Paddelack had spread the word; now the throngs lined
    the gorge to greet him. They sat on the outcroppings and waved. They stood
    upon rocks and cheered. The noise was deafening.
  </p>

  <p>
    A man ran up beside Pike and jogged along with him. <q ab:speaker="Massarat
    man">You have come to help us?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike nodded and the man bowed low, returning to his place in the
    crowd. Pike smiled after him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Massarat man 2">Will you take us out of the sun and the
    dark?</q> cried another.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike opened his mouth, hesitating. What could he answer? <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, I will try to do that. You have my word.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Massarat man 2">Thank you, Polkraitz Master.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike opened his mouth again to speak and almost held out his arm to stop
    the figure. But he didn't and resigned himself to the grask's loping
    walk. He stopped at Karrxlyn's tent, which was pitched with the others on
    the dusty plateau. Pike took a moment to view the ocean, so far away as to
    be virtually invisible but for the slight color change.
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn's arm caught his shoulder before he had turned away from the
    sight, and together they went into the tent.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">I am glad to see you here. I was informed of your
    coming several beclads ago. I trust you have recovered.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I hope so.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">I was beginning to wonder what happened to you and
    was contemplating sending an expedition to find you despite the Fear.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, I met the source of the Fear, and it is well you
    stayed away. I was nearly killed.…So I see recruits have been arriving. You
    have told them the Polkraitz are Returned?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn cocked an eyebrow. <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Haven't they?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Humph. Well, I suppose they have. How many recruits
    are there? The plateau is filled with them—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">—and they are dying from the sun because the
    Liddlefurans will not come out of hiding. We have let them be, as you
    instructed. But we cannot wait forever.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Not forever, not any longer. Have the supplies I
    brought down from the ship been sent over?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Yes. They are here.</q> Karrxlyn walked out of the
    tent and pointed to a small pile of bricks stacked on the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Good. Let's get some men.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn rounded up a handful of men, and Pike led them up the great stairs
    to the gate of Massarat. Pike himself directed the planting of the
    explosives at crucial points and armed them afterward.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back on the plateau, after the crowds had been cleared to the edge, far
    from the gorge, Pike turned to Karrxlyn. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Now we will
    show them what they have brought on themselves. They will learn to refuse
    our help.</q> He pressed the button on the detonator.
  </p>

  <p>
    The steps and the gate disappeared in a huge cloud of smoke and fire. Dust
    rose as the face of the gorge fell into itself. The roar was deafening,
    billowing upward and out like the explosion itself. The sky
    blackened. Karrxlyn fell to his feet, as did almost everyone present. When
    the rumbling had finally died away and the dust had settled, the fortress
    of Massarat was seen to be breached by giant, gaping holes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Go get them out,</q> Pike said to Karrxlyn, pulling
    him to his feet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn ordered rope brought. The stairs were of little use now, and they
    had to climb in.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike waited a telclad until Karrxlyn returned.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was a frown on the huge man's face. <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">There is
    no one inside, Commander.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No one! What do you mean, no one? Do you realize how
    many regulations I had to breach to bring those explosives? Do you think
    potential weapons are allowed in space without good reason? Are you telling
    me I wasted those precious bricks on a demonstration for no one?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">There was one person there…</q> Karrxlyn stood
    aside, and Paddelack entered the tent.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Paddy!</q> Pike took his old friend's dust-covered
    arm. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Come in. So you still want to get off
    Patra-Bannk, I see.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack said nothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Come on, now, let's forget about what's happened in
    the past. I'm willing to forget it if you are. Let's trade a blooded bronze
    on it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack smiled. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Pure and simple? All right.</q>
    He sat down in Karrxlyn's oversized chair before Pike could offer it to
    him. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Have you found the metallic hydrogen
    factory?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike bit his lip. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Almost, I think.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">That's a fine answer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I went to another city by the Fairtalian
    transportation system, which seems to be the same thing we saw at
    Daryephna, at least the map. I haven't the faintest idea of how the thing
    works. You go in and about five hours later you come out and there you
    are. Somehow I knew I was supposed to go to Neberdjer. The directions stuck
    in my mind from that first encounter with the Fear. And then when I got to
    Neberdjer, it happened again. I must have been out for weeks—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Don't say weeks. How did you eat? How did you
    survive?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">There was food there. But, as I was saying, Neberdjer
    tried to kill me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">You talked to the city?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Or something in the city, I'd say. It said it could
    take me to the metallic hydrogen facility. I suspect that was a lie,
    because it changed its mind.</q> Pike went on to explain what happened.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Anything else?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">It was worried about a <q>stability control
    mechanism.</q> I can certainly say I don't know what that is. I haven't
    seen any stabilities that need controlling. Do you understand it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack pulled his nose and squinted. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Stability
    control mechanism…stability control…Doesn't seem to be referring to
    stabilities, does it? I should go there myself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You'd be crazy, pure and simple. I'll tell you in more
    detail what happened there if you wish, but if you value your life, you
    will stay far away from that place. Not everyone on this planet is glad the
    Polkraitz are Returned.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What do you mean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Neberdjer said we are Polkraitz.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack winced. He looked at Pike first in outright disbelief, then with
    more than a trace of doubt. He remembered Pike's previous speculations: the
    Gostum claims, the Golun, the ships at Daryephna. The argument was tenuous,
    especially after this Neberdjer claimed it knew something about the
    metallic hydrogen. But then again, Neberdjer also said they were
    Polkraitz. Paddelack <em>had</em> always had difficulty in refuting Pike's
    arguments, he realized. There was always that cloying possibility that Pike
    was correct. And now…Paddelack looked up from the ground to Pike's face
    and, briefly, did see a Polkraitz Returned. Then he recovered. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Do you really believe it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I think the metallic hydrogen is a lie. There never
    was any more than we found. Our mission in that regard was a failure.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack jumped up. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Then let's leave, let's get
    out of here, go back to Two-Bit. You've caused enough trouble as it is.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike had risen and was now standing at the entrance to the tent, gazing out
    onto the plateau. Already repairs were beginning on the great steps as men
    and women carted away loose rock and began replacing it. They were singing
    as they worked in the rising sun of this Killer Bannk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike was spotted by the workers, and the cheers began to rise. He waved
    back slowly, smiled, and dropped his hand. <q ab:speaker="Pike">And do
    you,</q> he asked Paddelack, pointing to the scene, <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">believe in that?</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Twenty-Six</div>A Gathering of
  Friends</h2>

  <p>
    The sledge left two narrow furrows in the dirt that trailed off until they
    disappeared, following a sharp bend in the beach. The footprints that
    marred the neatness of the furrows were deep, the marks of heavy treads and
    labored walking. At frequent intervals even those footprints were
    obliterated by the outline of fallen bodies. Ahead, the path was blocked by
    a rocky outcropping where the woods jutted out almost to the water. The
    woods were not those of Ta-tjenen. Pod-trees had not been seen for many
    teclads. The plants that grew here might be cousins of the bamboo, faster
    growing than any weed, towering in height and sometimes breadth, but
    underneath as transient as the Bannk. A single Patra would reduce them to
    hibernating spores.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer put down the branch that served as a handle for the sledge, looked
    at his red-blistered hands, and pressed them against the small of his weary
    back. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Let's sit down in the shade,</q> he said as
    he contemplated how they were to cross the outcropping.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen walked up to one of the trees and sunk her knife into it. Water
    gushed forth and she filled her flask from the stream. Carefully she tasted
    it before offering a drink to Stringer. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I hope this
    town is not far,</q> she said.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer found his map cassette and scanned the coast. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I can't tell, exactly. Maybe another hundred
    kilometers, maybe more. But it's the next town on the route and looks
    big. It is our only choice.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Baluf man">Hey, Stranger! Where are you heading?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer jumped up abruptly and vainly scanned the woods for the
    source of the voice.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Baluf man">Why are you passing through Baluf lands?</q>
    the voice shouted again. Stringer only half understood the words.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">He doesn't sound very friendly,</q> Taljen said,
    voice modulating quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer waved her silent and moved toward the sailplane. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">We are traveling south to the next town for
    help. There is a city nearby, isn't there?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Baluf man">Are you friends of the Gostum?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was taken aback. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No,</q> he managed with
    a laugh.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Baluf man">Then why are you going to Pant? Only Gostum
    friends go there.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We need help.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Baluf man">Your dialect is strange and your speech
    deformed. Where are you from?</q> A man wearing loose clothing emerged from
    the woods. The stubble of a beard covered his face. He was followed by two
    men and two women.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Would he believe me if I told him?</q> Stringer
    wondered. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Who wants to know?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Baluf man">We are asking the questions. You are in our
    territory.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Baluf man 2">Enough of this!</q> one of the other men
    exclaimed as he stepped forward holding a knife.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer ducked behind the fuselage of the sailplane and reached into the
    cockpit. He drew out his kalan. Absent for so long, it felt strange in his
    swollen hand. His adversary waited for him to stand up, then leaped from
    the ledge on which he had been standing, onto the dirty sand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer sprang to life, using his last reserve of energy, and bounded over
    the plane. He caught his opponent's arm with the tip of the blade. Blood
    trickled, but the other man did not stop moving. Stringer saw him raise his
    knife, preparing to hurl it underhand. Stringer fell backward and the knife
    flew over his head, lodging itself in the peeling paint of the glider's
    fuselage. His enemy sprang, but Stringer managed to roll away and was on
    top of him in an instant, kalan ready to plunge into the base of the
    stranger's neck.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly he was surrounded by three others, knives drawn. His graser was
    still in the cockpit. Could he reach it? Taljen's leap toward the leader
    gave him the instant he needed. The three strangers reacted together, the
    kalan dipped deep into its target before the victim could even stir, and,
    within a heartbeat, Stringer had the graser out. So, he still had some
    speed left.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Hold!</q> Stringer
    shouted. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Or I'll kill you all before you move a
    centimeter.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Hold,</q> the leader said simultaneously to his
    followers. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Few men fight with a kalan too fast to
    be stopped. And Stringer is among them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer dropped his gun in shock. The word <q>kalan</q> followed by his
    name were two rapid-fire impossibilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Tis been a long time, yuh, Stringer?</q> the
    leader said in Stringer's old language.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Valyavar!</q> Stringer cried, peering into the
    other's eyes, clasping the rock-hard shoulders. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">You're supposed to be dead!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">And I thought you to be gone, sure.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I didn't even suspect—you've shaved! You really
    have a face! I didn't see your hands; I can hardly see a meter, I'm so
    sick. Even your skin didn't—I didn't <em>recognize</em> you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You look terrible, if you don't mind the
    observation. Looks as if Sarek did his best to finish you off. But you
    fight as always.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head as he took a long look at the body on the
    ground. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I was slow, out of practice, and almost
    dead. He nearly had me twice.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">My recognition was slow, too, too slow to stop
    you. I was so convinced you to be dead, I didn't suspect it was a kalan I
    was seeing, even an Alien.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Sorry,</q> Stringer said as he kicked the red
    sand.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer and Valyavar together">And how did you get
    here?</q> they asked each other simultaneously.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer and Valyavar together">That's a long story,</q>
    they answered in unison.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Best told over some food, yuh?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yuh!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Then gather your things and I'll take you to our
    home.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer collected the tent, his rodoft, and his few other supplies. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">What about the sailplane?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">These two will take it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen was standing alone all this time with sunken shoulders and heaving
    breast. Her sun suit had another tear to add to the growing collection.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What's wrong?</q> Stringer asked. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">We're among friends.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    She pointed with her chin in the direction of the dead man and brushed back
    tangles of her hair with swollen fingers. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You did
    that,</q> she said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes,</q> Stringer replied. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">And what did you have in mind when you lunged at
    Valyavar here?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen stammered. Stringer turned away with Valyavar and walked off the
    beach with him.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    It was story-telling time around the campfire. Valyavar talked his own
    brand of what was the universal language of Patra-Bannk.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Those Gostum are a nasty crew, to be believed for
    sure. Do you remember the crash? When I pulled you from the wreck,
    unconscious, no sooner had I done so than we were beset by Gostum, black
    and orange devils. I killed one of them before I realized they wanted me
    alive. They must have thought you were more than dead and ran off with me,
    leaving you and that other rascal alone.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer turned to Taljen. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why didn't you tell me
    it was a Gostum I ate and not Valyavar?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I told you when you first asked that we ate a
    Gostum. Whether or not it was your friend, we couldn't be expected to
    know. But you surely realized that finding you with the Gostum was one of
    the main reasons you were suspected of being Polkraitz.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer tried to remember the unfocused words of that first conversation
    but found that sounds without meaning were as ephemeral as sounds entirely
    unheard. He shook his head then. If there was any possible way of people's
    misunderstanding each other, they would. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Go on,
    Valyavar.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">To me it seems I was blindfolded, and when I awoke
    I was at Pant. To be sure, I didn't know it then. But I managed to get away
    from them when they were eating. So to truth, that's it. I ran far and came
    across some natives around here in Baluf land who put me Under for the
    Patra. God, to be sure, didn't show an interest, and I strike up another
    mark against him. But evidently my dress was appropriate. So I have been
    around here hunting what little is to be found and taking sturdy aim at the
    Gostum whenever they appear, no friends of mine, those. And now to cap it
    all, you run into me. I am amazed. What brought you to the middle of
    nowhere?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">A longer story than yours, from the sound of
    it. I'll tell you the details later. But perhaps the meeting is less
    amazing than we think. We were heading this way to begin with, and since
    everybody seems to live near the coast—our route—assuming you were alive
    and us, too, our paths would have crossed somewhere.…So, now we are here in
    the middle of nowhere. Do we stay forever or fix a sailplane?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Before you decide,</q> Valyavar said, <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">let me continue. A few beclads ago, if my memory for
    timelines hasn't flown from me completely, this girl, young enough to be a
    virgin, comes riding up from Pant alone, alone here in the Killer Bannk,
    the most reckless thing I ever set ears to.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar pointed to one of the two women who had been on the beach, now
    sitting around the fire. Stringer studied the girl. She seemed about his
    own age. Her shiny, waist-long black hair was braided and tied behind her
    head. Her skin, like that of all the natives this Bannk, was dark and
    lizardlike. A bolo was strapped around her slender waist and a knife hung
    across her chest opposite her water flask.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">She calls herself Barbalan,</q> Valyavar went on,
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">and said she was trying to find me. And that I
    must go south with her. Seems, it would be, that our friend Pike is down
    there and she knows where he's about. I'm not sure I trust her. She talks
    about as much as you used to, Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer had not taken his eyes off Barbalan, and she met his gaze without
    flinching. She surprised him by speaking first.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">You must also come south with me. It is
    imperative. We must go to Pike and take him with us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">We are all in great danger if we do not go south
    to Neberdjer. I am not sure why, exactly; I have only spoken to Neberdjer
    once and did not understand anything it told me. But I am sure this entire
    planet is in danger of being destroyed. Your help is needed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar boomed: <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Is that to be believed? Do you
    trust her?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer put his hand on Valyavar's knee to silence him. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Why are you doing this, Barbalan? Do you trust
    Neberdjer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes. Why am I doing this? Pike, too, wanted me to
    explain my actions. How can one explain one's self? I am the way I am. I am
    told that I do not speak much, that I act quickly, perhaps too
    quickly. Very well. I accept that. I do not consider myself and weigh
    myself as often as others do. I do not think it worth the time reflecting
    on myself; I am not worth it. I do what needs to be done.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer smiled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Valyavar, is she a saint or a
    maniac? How will we get to Neberdjer, Barbalan?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">The way will be difficult. I left Konndjlan—where
    we must go—without orders and, even worse, assisting an escape. That is
    punishable by death. You see…I am Gostum.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Both Taljen and Valyavar sprang up. Valyavar grabbed his knife, but
    Barbalan was faster.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer held back the giant's arm. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Now, don't go
    nonlinear,</q> he said in the old language. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">She
    obviously means no harm. Go on, Barbalan. Talk slowly so I can understand
    you.</q> He noticed out of the corner of his eye that Taljen had left the
    campfire.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Shortly after Pike arrived in Konndjlan last
    Bannk, there arose a rumor in Konndjlan that another Alien had been
    captured in the north but had escaped at Pant. Later I helped Pike escape
    from Konndjlan, and soon I encountered Neberdjer at Daryephna. When Pike
    refused to go to Neberdjer, I thought I should find this other Alien. I
    returned Pike to Konndjlan and followed the pendant map to the stala in the
    desert. Normally that fifty kilometers would not have been difficult, but
    how I survived those winds I still do not know. With the information in the
    pendant it was easy to guess how to use the stala to get to Pant. I stayed
    there all last Patra, assuming that until this Bannk the Gostum at Pant
    would not know I was there without orders. I escaped near dawn, but that
    was teclads ago. Now that I have found you at last, the Bannk is more than
    half done, and the Gostum at Pant have certainly learned by now that I am a
    fugitive. My life is in danger both there and at Konndjlan.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">If you are recognized,</q> Stringer added.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar glanced at Stringer. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You'd be to risk
    it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Well,</q> Valyavar said, cocking his eyebrows, <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">what is it that you're thinking?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Tell me, Barbalan, if what I say is true. Many
    people are going south to the place called Konndjlan for a great
    gathering. Rumors abound of the Polkraitz returning. The Gostum are taking
    anyone south who will go—and some who won't. Villages we have recently
    passed are being deserted for whatever is happening. Why don't we just go
    with them?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">It may work,</q> Valyavar agreed. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">I have noticed the migration myself. But there is one
    problem. Except for old friends who fail to recognize one another because
    thought dead, we clearly look Alien this Bannk, to even a blind man.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">That may help,</q> Barbalan said. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">It may be your safe passage.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Barbalan, how long would it take?</q> Stringer
    asked, remembering the Patra was not infinitely far away.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">From Pant? Ten telclads.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Ten telclads! And how far is Konndjlan? A walk
    over the next hill?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Beyond the World's Edge, if there is one. From the
    old map it must be nearly fifty thousand kilometers.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You are joking.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">No,</q> Barbalan replied.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer looked at <em>Nothing</em> strapped in pieces to the sledge. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">We spent more than half the Bannk flying here in that
    thing. Ten telclads to go as far as we've come already? I usually sleep
    longer than that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes,</q> Barbalan repeated, <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">ten, as near as I can guess.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer puzzled over that as he began to stamp out the fire and gather up
    his things. Valyavar disappeared with his friends. The strangers returned,
    leading four grask. Barbalan threw a leather sack over one and mounted. In
    a moment Valyavar returned with his own sack, the same one he had always
    carried on Two-Bit, and a kalan strapped to his waist. He spent a few
    moments with a tall, dark, curly-haired girl. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">You'll see me again,</q> he said, and kissed her.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not a second later he was mounted on the tallest grask. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">Come on, Stringer! After your journey, the trip to
    Pant is not even a child's punishment.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, <em>Nothing</em>,</q> Stringer said to the
    sailplane he had fashioned with his own hands, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">you've done better than I ever believed was
    possible. Maybe you will fly again sometime.</q> He patted the faded nose
    of the bird and turned away, only to bump into a bamboo tree. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I have better luck flying,</q> he grumbled, and grabbed
    the reins of the grask that was waiting for him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before them, in a shallow valley covered with dull greens and browns, lay
    Pant, founded by the Gostum when the stala to that Elsewhere had opened
    up. Stringer led his grask out of the woods and sat down on the hill to
    rest. He glanced at the sun and winced. Was it seventy degrees? Was it
    eighty or ninety? All Stringer knew was that a pan of water didn't boil
    sitting on the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly they were surrounded by Gostum. <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard">What
    business do you have in Pant?</q> asked one from atop his mount.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar answered. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">We have heard that you wish
    help in the south. We have come to help.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Gostum smiled, teeth shining. <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard">Where are
    you from?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    All hesitated, except Taljen. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">From Ta-tjenen,</q>
    she said proudly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">From Baluf land,</q> Valyavar said, pointing to
    the remaining three.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard">Come with us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They were marched into the center of a town whose houses were largely open
    to the wind. Their escorts stopped at a hut. The Gostum who had spoken
    before stared a long time at Barbalan. Her hair had been hidden, her faced
    dirtied, her Gostum black exchanged for a loose white tunic. If the guard
    had known her once, recognition did not come now. He said, <q
    ab:speaker="Gostum guard">You will stay in this room until we are ready to
    take you south. Your weapons, please…They will be returned.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer and Valyavar unstrapped their kalans and handed them
    over. Barbalan unwound her bolo and unslung her knife.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard">Leave your packs outside with this guard.</q>
    The guard sitting on the step seemed uninterested in anything but staying
    out of the way of the sun and the loose dirt that flew around them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer pulled out his journal from the tent sack. The guard let him keep
    it. Barbalan and Valyavar put down their sacks and stepped over the guard
    into the hut. Stringer was about to follow when the leader took Taljen by
    the arm and told her, <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard">You will come with
    me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What?</q> Stringer shouted.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard">You said you were from Triesk, is that not
    true?</q> the guard asked Taljen.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I said I was from Ta-tjenen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard">That is what I thought. The ancient name. You
    will come with me.</q> To Stringer he said, <q ab:speaker="Gostum
    guard">She must be held until further instructions are received to see if
    her travel is allowed. She will be questioned.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen yanked her arm free but did not run.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I won't let you!</q> Stringer shouted.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer, what can you do?</q> Taljen asked. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">I will see you in the south, perhaps.</q> She followed
    the guard after leaving Stringer alone in the sun.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No!</q> he called after her. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">We can't risk—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Silence for now, Stringer,</q> Barbalan whispered
    in his ear as she caught his arm. She dragged him into the hut and shut the
    door behind them. The entire building shook and the hinges creaked with
    rust.
  </p>

  <p>
    The three sat facing each other in the middle of the stifling room. The
    floor, made of half-rotted planks, was green and purple with mold and
    sagged under their weight.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Wonderful,</q> Stringer sighed. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">What now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I might have foreseen this,</q> Barbalan said. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">Both Gostum and your friend Pike wanted to know of
    Triesk, and Taljen is from Triesk—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Taljen is from Ta-tjenen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I am afraid they are the same place,</q> Barbalan
    said, shaking her head sadly. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Taljen might have
    valuable information. I should have warned you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was rapping his knuckles rapidly on the floor. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">What will they do to her?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I don't know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We gave them our weapons, like idiots—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Stringer, weapons won't do us any good in the
    middle of Pant. But let me think a moment.</q> After a few minutes of
    silence Barbalan looked up. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Do we need Taljen
    south?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you mean? Leave her here? No, I can't let
    you do that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">No, you misunderstand. I mean, what good is
    rescuing her at Pant and taking her to Konndjlan to be recaptured?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded at the reasoning. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Where can we
    take her?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan raised her thin eyebrows hopefully. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">Triesk?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Can you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">If it is possible to take her anywhere, we can
    take her to Triesk. But—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">—can we take her anywhere?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan once again lowered her head in thought. Stringer and Valyavar must
    be brought south at all costs. That was important. And she was still
    Gostum. Abruptly, she stood up and leaned out the window. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">Guard, we're hungry. Can I have that gray sack with
    food in it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The guard ambled off the step and picked up the sack. Barbalan bit her lip
    and he opened it, but he saw only some freshly cut meat. He handed her the
    sack and sat down again. Barbalan tried closing all the windows, but most
    of the shutters, swollen from the damp, did not fit properly. She dumped
    the contents of the bag onto the floor. Her black Gostum uniform toppled
    out on top of the food. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Luckily we have a sleepy
    guard out there. I will report him myself if the chance comes. Now, perhaps
    I can be of use as a Gostum. Remember, I may not.</q> She talked as she
    began undressing. Stringer openly admired the sight of the slender beauty
    in her rugged Killer Bannk skin. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">My life may be
    wanted—it should be. If I am recognized, I will be killed. It is that
    simple.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So what are you planning?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">To go and get Taljen. I will simply go and get
    her. You can even come.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">There are hundreds of Gostum at Pant. I stayed
    close to myself all Patra, so how many can know who I am? As long as we are
    not seen by someone who knows me, we are safe.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Won't you be questioned?</q> Stringer asked,
    biting his lip.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">No one of lower rank will challenge this,</q> she
    said as she struggled to get the Fairtalian necklace over her head. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">We are again in luck that the previous owner was more
    well endowed than myself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer smiled at this girl who could be so resigned to the constant
    danger and yet deal with it so calmly. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What about
    higher rank?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Few and far between. The man outside certainly
    isn't. Are the odds acceptable to you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes. My mind is blocked; I can't think of anything
    else to do. I'm glad you can.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Then I think it is usually better to do something
    than nothing. Let's go.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Indeed,</q> Valyavar laughed somberly, <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">she is a saint or a maniac.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan flung open the door. The guard jumped to his feet and whirled
    about, his short spear ready for action. His eyes came to rest on the
    necklace and slipped down to the pendant hanging across Barbalan's
    breast. She did not wait for him to be startled. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">This is a secret mission. Give us our sacks and
    weapons.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The guard did as he was told without any hesitation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Where is the other girl being kept?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard 2">In the hut across the yard.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Come, Stringer.</q> She waved them out of the shed
    and onto the dirt yard, which was covered by a profusion of hoof
    prints. Stringer thought that short walk in the sun was the longest he had
    ever taken. As they approached the opposite side of the court and the
    waiting guard, Barbalan sucked in her breath, so far that her diaphragm
    moved visibly. Stringer knew what that meant and prayed for anonymity on
    Barbalan's part.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">You'll do nothing,</q> Barbalan said, as if
    anticipating Stringer's planned action. She stepped ahead. Stringer still
    admired her courage but now wondered if hers was the only life in
    danger. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I want the woman from Triesk to take
    south,</q> she said without a hint of nervousness.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard 3">Are the others going also?</q> the guard
    asked, scanning Barbalan quickly and then dwelling on Stringer and
    Valyavar.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes.</q> Barbalan felt her heart beating and
    forced control.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard 3">Fine,</q> came the response, and the guard
    ducked into the hut to bring forth a quiet Taljen.
  </p>

  <p>
    The four walked toward the center of town and the stala. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">I don't understand,</q> Barbalan said. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">He should have recognized me, unless I am so
    radically changed in appearance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I don't suspect it's God's intervention—yet,</q>
    Valyavar chuckled.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">The problem ahead is not one to laugh at. Only the
    Fairtalian are allowed unblindfolded into the stala. You see those
    guards. They will be Fairtalian and will question me. Be prepared for a
    fight.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is crazy, Stringer thought.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Stringer, I will take Taljen to Triesk. Do you
    wish to come with me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    At that remark, Stringer suddenly forgot that they were in immediate
    danger. He was now only conscious of the four of them standing along under
    the mid-bannk sun, the same deadly sun, high in the south, that had done
    its best to kill them and failed. Taljen, dirty, clothing torn, hair
    tangled, and hands blistered, remained undiminished, regal always, even
    next to the extraordinary Barbalan, who stood by her lithe and
    slender. Taljen had not spoken a word in the last few moments, hardly more
    during the last few beclads. What could be said now?
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Is it necessary that I go?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I don't think so. It will probably be safer for
    you if you arrived in Konndjlan without me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">There is nothing for me in
    Ta-tjenen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Then say your farewells now.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer walked up to Taljen, brushed her loose cowl aside, and kissed her
    lightly on her cracked lips. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Good-bye, Taljen,</q>
    he said simply.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Will I see you again, Stringer?</q> she asked in
    return.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't know.</q> He pulled the battered journal
    from the tent sack and handed it to her. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Give this
    to Alhane. It may amuse him.</q> Taljen took the book without looking at
    it. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I wish I had something to give you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Good-bye, Stringer, Alien Nesta, good-bye.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan nudged them to the stala. It was a much larger building than any
    other in Pant. Stringer was sure it was metal, a giant cylinder with a
    spire on top. He wrinkled his nose, puzzled that such a thing should be
    found here.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fairtalian guard">Halt!</q> shouted the Fairtalian guarding
    the stala. <q ab:speaker="Fairtalian guard">What business do you have
    here?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">To take these south to Konndjlan.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The guards eyed them thoroughly, concentrating on Stringer and Valyavar. <q
    ab:speaker="Fairtalian guard 1">Do you intend to take them yourself?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fairtalian guard 1">Blindfold them.</q> One of the guards
    produced three blindfolds, which were then fastened around Taljen and the
    Aliens. The chief guard stepped aside, but only after he had taken their
    kalans and given them to Barbalan for her keeping. She smiled in thanks as
    she took her companions through the opening door. It shut behind them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan quickly glanced around and saw no one else present. She removed
    the blindfolds from her hostages and handed out the weapons.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer had only a moment to regard his surroundings: the huge chamber
    room whose circumference was lined with doors and whose center was
    dominated by a huge cylindrical map. He had only a brief glimpse before
    Barbalan shoved him to an opening door. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Hurry! In
    you go before someone comes!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer hesitated, staring for a second at Taljen. Then he turned and
    entered the awaiting room. The door shut silently and Taljen, already
    turning away, was lost from view.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Twenty-Seven</div>Another
  Homecoming</h2>

  <p>
    Barbalan grabbed Taljen's hand and quickly pulled her into the room that
    would take them to Triesk. Taljen stumbled after her, the door shut, and
    they were on their way. Sitting down, Barbalan pulled her hair back and let
    a heavy sigh of relief escape her lungs. She felt safe now, a feeling that
    would hold for ten telclads. It wasn't often in recent memory that she had
    felt safe.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen did not speak at all for most of the trip but just stared gloomily
    at the floor. Finally Barbalan asked her, <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Do you
    understand, Taljen, that I must take Stringer south?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen nodded without looking up.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I hope you understand that I must take him south
    to meet the others. He will be safe now, I am sure. But you would be in
    danger where he is going; I am also sure of that equally well. So it is
    necessary to bring you back to Triesk. I am sorry that you must leave
    Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen raised her head and looked at Barbalan, saying nothing still for a
    long time. Finally she cleared her throat and spread her palms on her
    thighs. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Perhaps, Barbalan, Met in the South, it is
    time for me to leave Stringer. Do you know that Stringer and I traveled
    farther than I thought the world was wide? There was hunger, sickness;
    death was close many times. We were lovers—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">You experienced a great deal together; I can
    understand your happiness.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No. My unhappiness is not at leaving him. There is
    still much I don't understand about Stringer. I gave him more of my life
    than I ever conceived of giving to anyone. But he wanted something from me
    that I still don't understand. He is searching for something that I don't
    comprehend. Sometimes I think he just hasn't grown up right; other
    times…Barbalan, With Darker Hair Than Mine, you seem like Stringer in a
    way: often silent but knowing much more about this world than I do. I envy
    you that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan shook her head. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">My comprehension is no
    greater than yours, I am afraid. Almost everything is beyond me and I act
    as a blind woman, only guessing which way to turn. Why I must take Stringer
    south, I do not fully understand; why people are going south, I don't know
    yet, either. What this room is that is now taking us to Triesk is as much a
    mystery to me as it is to you. There is a lot in this world that I do not
    understand.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen managed to smile a little. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You sound a little
    like my old teacher, the Time Keeper. He always said that he never
    understood anything. I never thought he did, either; everything he said was
    so contrary to fact. But then Stringer arrived, and everything the Time
    Keeper said turned out to be true. So I wonder how little you know,
    Barbalan.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I think that after seeing so much of the world,
    you probably know much more than I.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">We stopped at dozens of villages. Most never heard
    of mighty Ta-tjenen. Many said that they did not use the Parlztluzan,
    although they can all trace their ancestry back to Ta-tjenen. It was so
    hard to comprehend the way they lived. Do the Gostum use the
    Parlztluzan?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan shook her head. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I have never heard of
    it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">And was Stringer right about that, too?</q> Taljen's
    voice rose in pitch. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Is he ever wrong? This is all
    too much for me. I cannot separate illusion from reality any more. I think
    I am as afraid to go back to Ta-tjenen as I was to leave it. I am only part
    Tjenen now. Please, Barbalan, if you ever succeed in what you are trying to
    do, tell me. I would like to think that I am a part of this new world.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes, I will make a point of that, Taljen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">One thing more…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Take care of Stringer, especially protect him from
    himself. He has never understood how dangerous he can be. Oh, Barbalan,
    Stringer is such a contradiction to me. He could do many good things; his
    energy seems boundless, like the Time Keeper's. But he walks like a blinded
    man, not seeing where his energy is spent. The same hand that spins a tune
    on the rodoft will slit a throat. Always I had missed seeing the tension
    within him until I saw him kill your companion on the beach. Then I came to
    know that whatever world bred him was a much harsher place than
    Patra-Bannk. That struggle is not in Ta-tjenen, was not in me. That is why
    I missed seeing it; that is why we have failed to understand each
    other. Barbalan, take care of Stringer, especially from himself.…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I shall make the attempt. I promise.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen smiled now, openly, but the conversation lapsed into silence again,
    this time until the trip ended with a faint thud. They emerged into a stala
    very much like the one they had left, but larger, much larger.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although Barbalan had never been there before, she easily found the
    exit. The door slid open as always and the hot air rushed in.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes, this is the longest Bannk,</q> she said,
    stepping into the light of the unmerciful sun burning down from above,
    though not as high as in the south. Taljen drew on her cowl and followed
    Barbalan out. The Gostum woman moved away from the stala and saw that it
    had been camouflaged with earth and fern-moss. From any distance it would
    not be visible. It stood hidden from sight in the bottom of a small
    clearing, which itself was nestled in a valley surrounded by hills on all
    sides.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Where is your city?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I'm not sure. I have not been here before. Maybe
    that way.</q> Taljen pointed south and they set off. They climbed for two
    or three telclads over the hills, barren but for fern-moss and a few
    shrubs. From the final summit they looked down. There was Ta-tjenen beneath them.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">So that is Triesk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Ta-tjenen,</q> Taljen corrected.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">A great city. But you did not know of the stala,
    just over the first hills?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No. We rarely go in that direction, if at all. Why
    should we?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">A curious people, these Trieskans. Will you tell
    them about it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">About what? If I could find the spot again, would
    the stala, as you call it, be there? Or will the magic disappear with you?
    Would anyone even believe me to go and look? Or would the stala be
    reconciled to the Golun-Patra? Do I believe it? Of course not. How can I? I
    don't know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Then before I roast alive, I think that it is time
    I leave you. Triesk isn't a good place for Gostum, is it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No, it isn't; there is more than certainty in
    that. Good-bye, Barbalan. I hope you—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes, I know. So do I. Have a good life, Taljen,
    and do not mourn Stringer too long. He is not one to be mourned yet, I
    suspect.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen was silhouetted against the daylight, so Barbalan did not see her
    smile. Both turned away at the same time and parted company.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen opened her water flask, found it empty, as it always seemed to be,
    and scurried down the north hills. She saw the black remains of the forest
    that had burned out last Bannk and knew that soon she would be working
    overtime to collect fuel and ensure that the supplies were more than
    adequate. The houses, she could see with solofar eyes, were repaired, as
    well they should be past Mid-Bannk. Ta-tjenen was still Ta-tjenen. The wind
    caught her hair, a drier and cooler wind than at Pant, but, nonetheless,
    the same wind that had carried her so far south. Or was all that just a
    dream? Taljen could hardly decide was was only glad that here, at the
    Center, the sun was more merciful than it was beyond the Edge of the World.
  </p>

  <p>
    At last below the city, she began to climb up the wide steps cut into the
    flank of the citadel. The streets were totally deserted. She should have
    expected that in the Killer Bannk, but for some reason she was
    surprised. Taljen passed one group of people hauling logs. They stared at
    her, not shouting any greeting. Was that because they were Tjenens or
    because she was not welcome?
  </p>

  <p>
    But the plaza was still white, and the sun's hazy shadow, peering through a
    thick atmosphere, stopped abruptly at the shortest of the metal scales,
    indicating early afternoon for this longest Bannk. Taljen saw the marker
    for the Parlztluzan. Who would be her nesta next Bannk?
  </p>

  <p>
    An old woman—a member of the nestrexam?—was making her hurried way to the
    meeting tent. Taljen did not understand why the meetings were being held
    Above this Bannk. For a scorching second the woman halted and gaped at the
    newcomer, then turned and scurried off. Taljen knew that her arrival was
    now public.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few belclads more and Taljen was at the outskirts of town, near Alhane's
    house by the city wall. His yard was covered with new instruments of shiny
    metal glistening in the sun and hot to the touch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside, she heard voices. Certainly one was Alhane's; the other voices must
    be his children's. Taljen listened.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You see the tangled mess it is! I can't make it any
    simpler, even as my father failed to do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane's child">Then why don't you listen to what he in his
    writings told you and the Alien said also: Put the sun in the center.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But how ridiculous can that be? Would nature allow
    such a thing, I ask you? No, it is too hard to accept.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen stepped in at that moment, and the bitterness in her voice was
    unmistakable. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Why don't you put the sun in the
    center and see what good it does you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Taljen!</q> Alhane shouted. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Is that you? By Lashgar, I never though I'd put my eyes
    to you again! You dared come back. Amazing!</q> He ran up to her and hugged
    her rigid body. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">How did you get back? Yes, this
    <em>is</em> interesting!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I…I don't remember.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Are you telling me falsely?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen shook her head; she wasn't lying. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No, I can't
    remember. I don't know. But Stringer wanted me to give you this.</q> She
    handed Alhane the battered journal. Then she began to cry and didn't stop
    for a very long time.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Twenty-Eight</div>A Second
  Gathering of Friends</h2>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Tseems that the Polkraitz were an amazing
    bunch,</q> Valyavar said as he ran his hands over the wall of the room in
    which he and Stringer found themselves. He sat down on one of the many
    couches and stretched out his giant's legs, scratched his already growing
    beard, and relaxed. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">To assume, this was the way I
    was taken from Triesk to Pant.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Absolutely,</q> Stringer agreed, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">but I'm sure the Polkraitz had nothing to do with
    this.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You know for sure?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I saw some Polkraitz writing once, on a ship at
    Ta-tjenen. It's much like the writing the Tjenens use themselves, which
    makes sense since everyone seems to be descended from the same original
    group. You notice everyone speaks the same language, even though over the
    years different dialects have grown up, and everyone is biologically
    identical. Anyway, the writing on the stala was very different; I had time
    to notice that as we entered. And while I'm not yet certain why the
    Polkraitz were here, clearly all the Tjenen stories and the ones we heard
    on the way south are consistent in one thing: that the Polkraitz came and
    departed something over a thousand years ago. Just as clearly, this planet
    was built earlier than that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">What?</q> Valyavar screamed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You didn't know, then? It's been coming to me in
    nightmares and by bits and pieces ever since I got here, almost as if
    somebody were trying to tell me. But in any case, I'm convinced this planet
    is artificial. It is the only conclusion that fits all the
    observations.</q> He went on to explain to Valyavar all his experiences,
    nebulous as they were, that had convinced him the planet was not
    natural. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And so,</q> he concluded, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">just by the very fact that this planet is here, with
    mountains, water, life, all of which must be well over one thousand years
    old, the Polkraitz couldn't have had anything to do with it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Sounds good,</q> Valyavar said. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">The gravity bothered me, too, but I couldn't make it
    stick. I just didn't know enough to decide. It is hard for someone like me
    to think in terms of artificial planets, that's a certainty.</q> Suddenly
    he turned pale. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">A big mistake.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What's that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Seems that this transport is top-secret, to be
    used only by those Fairtalian unless passengers are escorted and
    blindfolded by the same. How is it going to look when we show up, clearly
    not Fairtalian—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">—and not blindfolded. I see your point. I wonder
    if we can turn this thing around. Do you think these are controls of some
    sort?</q> Stringer stood up and examined the devices that lined the front
    end of the compartment. There seemed to be three widely differing
    constructions, and he didn't know if they were controls or decorations. He
    began fiddling randomly with any of these that fit his hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Hey! Are you sure that's a good idea?</q> Valyavar
    shouted as he jumped up from his reclining position. But he grew quickly
    silent as the front end of the room became transparent. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">What are we seeing?</q> he whispered.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm not sure.</q> But in a way, Stringer knew. The
    tube that stretched ahead of them to infinity, fading away as it got
    smaller and smaller, was surely a tunnel. Three bulges in the tube, spaced
    equally at one hundred twenty degrees, ran along the tunnel wall until they
    converged at the vanishing point. What was most frightening were the
    luminescent circles that ran around the inner circumference of the
    tube. They formed a reference grid. And they were moving. Stringer picked
    out a small ring near infinity, almost unresolvable, and watched it grow
    until it was moving so fast over his head that it was invisible.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">We're traveling,</q> Valyavar said flatly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer snorted. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">There is some truth to that,</q>
    he said, lying down.
  </p>

  <p>
    After perhaps two telclads of sleep, although Stringer could only guess at
    this, Valyavar tapped him on the shoulder. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">We've
    been speeding up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer rose to his feet and went to the window. The circles were no
    longer individually visible, just blurs now, providing the whole tunnel
    with a dim glow that alternated in intensity as they swept by. Stringer
    squeezed his eyes shut in disbelief and began pacing the room, peering into
    the cabinets, anything just to avoid looking ahead. He found spacesuits in
    one of the storage closets. Just for fun, he tried one on to see if it
    would fit, and it seemed alive, adjusting to his body as if it were made
    for him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Perhaps another two telclads had passed—who could tell?—when Valyavar made
    his second announcement. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">We're slowing again.</q>
    Indeed, the circles were once more becoming visible.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Funny, I don't feel as if we're slowing. I don't
    feel as if we're moving at all.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Soon the rings spaced themselves at wider and wider intervals, until they
    barely crawled past. Eventually the last ring, glowing dimly, went by, and
    no more were to be seen. The passengers felt a slight bump, an upward
    acceleration, and that was all. Within a few moments the cabin door opened
    and Valyavar, with one hand on his kalan and the other on one of Stringer's
    grasers, walked out. Stringer followed, cat-like and circumspect.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">This way,</q> Valyavar said, pointing to what
    seemed to be the exit. As they emerged outside they were met by a blast of
    superheated air.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Sarek! Verlaxchi! What a furnace!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer almost ran back into the stala but knew there would be little
    point in that. He looked around and saw orange sand and mountains that rose
    like a wall not two centimeters from his eyes and cut off half the
    sky. Stringer was becoming frantic; the air was searing in his throat and
    tearing at his lungs, and he thought that his clothes would catch fire. He
    was sure he would die within moments. His ears perked up: the sound to his
    left could only be that of trickling water. He ran around and suddenly he
    was in the shade, water dripping on his head from a troughlike awning above
    him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar was not far behind, clutching at his own throat. Cupping his hand
    to catch some of the leaking water, he drank and spat. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">It's almost as hot as this air! Sarek!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But it's saving our lives. Look.</q> Stringer
    pointed to a wide awning with green foliage dangling from its top. Mounted
    on bamboolike posts, it ran across the desert to vanish at the base of the
    nearby mountains.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar stared for a moment and then looked in the other direction. Not
    ten meters behind him, the trough angled toward the ground, spilling its
    contents into a large lake. The water did have to go somewhere. At the lake
    were grask, drinking, and by the grask were Gostum. They were not wearing
    black, but white. Nonetheless, the orange stripe made their identity
    unmistakable. Valyavar raised his pistol as he tugged on Stringer's arm.
  </p>

  <p>
    The nearest Gostum saw them and signaled to the others. There were at least
    a dozen, hiding in the shade of the stala. Stringer was already poised for
    fighting.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Little Stringer, 'tis not to be foolish. They
    haven't killed us yet, so let it be.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer lowered his kalan as they were surrounded.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fairtalian guard 2">You are the Aliens,</q> one of the
    Gostum said, scratching his rough face with his sixth finger. <q
    ab:speaker="Fairtalian guard 2">We have been expecting you. We will take
    you to the Commander.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar shook his head in puzzlement. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Soon I may
    be placing faith in God.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Let's hope you're not dressing warmly, at
    least.</q> Stringer grinned as he mounted the grask that had been brought
    for him. He expected the trip to take a telclad, no more, the mountains
    seemed so close. But the fifty-kilometer ride stretched on and on in agony,
    with the shade above and the cooling water doing little to alleviate the
    pain.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fairtalian guard 2">This is a new project the Commander
    initiated,</q> the Fairtalian explained with pride. <q
    ab:speaker="Fairtalian guard 2">It was only completed at Mid-Bannk. We had
    to divert a river, import material from the north, and build it with the
    labor of thousands of our recruits. The Commander is wise. The channel
    makes the stala so much more accessible now that it is being used
    constantly. The new recruits are being housed at Massarat.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer hardly paid attention. Massarat meant nothing to him; the heat on
    the desert under the sun did. Finally, no matter how much he stretched his
    head, he could see nothing but the mountains. The crew-cut grask began to
    climb, and the temperature—thank Lashgar—dropped a little. Why the Gostum
    lived in the mountains became remarkably clear.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer only vaguely remembered seeing a large stone slab rise in front of
    him, signaling their arrival. He had been slumped over the neck of the
    grask at the time. He remembered even less of the drawbridge and passed out
    totally within clads after that.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he awoke, he had no idea how long he had been asleep. Valyavar was
    still snoring next to him on some large cushions. Soon a guard entered the
    room.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard 4">The Commander will see you any time you
    wish—if you are rested.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer found himself eager to see Pike again; what this Commander
    business was about, he didn't know. In fact, he was so eager that he rolled
    over to Valyavar and shook the sleeping giant to awaken him. Eventually
    Valyavar complied, and soon after they were trotting into the council
    chamber. Even before he saw Pike, Stringer heard the clack, clack of a
    giant clock and was surprised to see two men standing on either side of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Friends!</q> came the joyous shout as Pike rose from a
    huge table to greet them. <q ab:speaker="Pike">We've been expecting
    you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So we've been told,</q> Stringer remarked as he
    took Pike's arm.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Valyavar <em>and</em> Stringer! I had been told one
    was alive, but two is truly amazing. One chance in a million!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Tis true, we've had more than some luck. Seeing
    you is a good thing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You look as if you've been through a few things
    yourself,</q> observed Pike, standing back.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And you. Commander? Look at yourself. Gold,
    bracelets, necklaces. You look positively decadent.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike frowned deeply but quickly recovered his smile. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">It helps get things done around here. The Gostum have
    certain traditions to which it is wise to adhere. Sit down with me. Let's
    have some drink.</q> Pike waved his arms.
  </p>

  <p>
    They sat down at a long table covered with an elaborately woven
    cloth. Stringer saw many figures on it, many weapons, and other things less
    distinguishable. Absently he picked at the edges, and pieces fell off in
    his hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You seem to be highly regarded,</q> Valyavar
    said. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">The observation's clear enough.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">We're Polkraitz, aren't we?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer frowned. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Are you serious?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike didn't answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just then three men walked in: a tall, husky man, about the same build as
    Valyavar, a young man with blond hair, and another who, in this
    surrounding, was clearly Alien.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Ah,</q> Pike said. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Meet
    Paddelack, my right-hand man. I never would have survived without him, nor
    he without me, I suspect. He came here with Hendig more than twenty years
    ago and has managed to stay alive ever since.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Tis something to doubt. A feat to be wondered at,
    yuh?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">There was no alternative. Stranded,</q> Paddelack
    said. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">So tell me, where've you been?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was still feeling tired and now a little cranky, but he
    answered. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Ta-tjenen. I think it's called Triesk
    down here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    A rumble emerged from the standing giant, an eyebrow was raised at the
    blond-haired boy, and Pike's face lit up. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Tell me,
    Stringer, did you see rockets at Triesk?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, I saw two.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike slammed his fist down on the table and glared at Paddelack. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">You see, Paddelack, the Gostum have always been right,
    and you have always been a fool not to believe me. The Polkraitz again
    demonstrate their greatness, and the mission is even more clear.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer cocked his head. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why is everyone so taken
    by the Polkraitz?</q> he asked, yawning.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You have not seen the great city, but you have seen
    the stala. A great work, is it not? Now you add the rockets we have always
    suspected.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Nonsense,</q> Stringer objected, shaking his
    head. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Who were they?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Originators of all of which I have just spoken—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The Polkraitz were nothing of the kind.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">How can you say that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">From the evidence at Triesk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Ah, yes, the Trieskans. Merely prisoners of the
    Polkraitz.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Perhaps. Or maybe they were prisoners of the
    Gostum, and the Polkraitz were gone long before then and had nothing to do
    with it all. Or maybe you're right. If I were holding them prisoners and
    didn't want them to escape, I'd surely tell them the world was flat with an
    edge to fall off and that Ta-tjenen was the only place there was. On the
    other hand, the Tjenens seem to feel they were the victors of the Great
    Revolt. Tell me, who were the Polkraitz?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">They built Daryephna, the city we came to find. I saw
    it with my own eyes, a wondrous city—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I doubt it. The Polkraitz were here and gone over
    a thousand years ago. Maybe they came to investigate the planet, as we did,
    and found the stalas at Triesk and Konndjlan. Maybe something happened and
    they had to leave suddenly, abandoning some behind. Maybe there was a
    revolt. Maybe all that revolt stuff is two-thousand-odd years of
    embellishment. But one thing I'm sure of is that the Polkraitz, whoever
    they were, left for good. Who would come back to this hell? They'd have to
    be fools.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike shook his head violently. <q ab:speaker="Pike">A great race! They
    built wonders! You have seen them yourself!</q> He was screaming.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Look,</q> Stringer said as calmly as he could
    manage. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How many people live on Patra-Bannk?
    Triesk has something like twenty thousand. I doubt there are three times
    that many in all other places combined—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Twenty thousand! We underestimated! How could the
    mistake have been made?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack urged Stringer to continue.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So the Polkraitz disappeared twelve belbannks ago,
    leaving behind the origins of the present population. How many people could
    there have been then to produce the population we see now? Use your
    head. What could it have been? Several hundred? A few thousand? Maybe the
    famous Lashgar had fifty followers, who knows?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">It can't be, it mustn't be!</q> cried Pike.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why not? How many fought in the battle of the
    Transhi pass? A hundred?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">But the city—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't yet understand that city,</q> Stringer
    replied in a lowered voice, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">or why it is the only
    one to be found, or why anything else, but I am sure that city is ages
    older than anything the Polkraitz built. Maybe they stumbled on it as
    Hendig did, but they didn't build it, I can tell you that. I want you to
    take me to Daryephna.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">That is impossible. I have been there and explored
    it. Triesk has more to offer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack had stood up and was facing the entrance way. Silence gradually
    fell about the table as Paddelack ran from the argument.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Barbalan!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike stood up. <q ab:speaker="Pike">It is good to see you, Barbalan. I had
    been informed by the guards from Pant that you went there searching for
    Valyavar. Thus I gave orders to leave you unhindered. Good work.</q> He
    smiled benevolently.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer and Valyavar exchanged glances of understanding.
  </p>

  <p>
    At that another guard walked in. Stringer wondered where he had seen him
    before, and recently.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fairtalian guard 1">You asked to see me, Commander?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike responded angrily. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I ordered the Trieskan woman
    to be brought here not a half-beclad ago. Where is she?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The guard pointed to Barbalan. <q ab:speaker="Fairtalian guard 1">She took
    her.</q> He swiveled toward the conference table. <q ab:speaker="Fairtalian
    guard 1">And these two were with her.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike began to shake uncontrollably. He grasped the bracelet on his left
    wrist and turned it back and forth. He could smell the oil from the burning
    torches. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Is this true?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">There must be a mistake,</q> Stringer lied.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Yuh, what's he talking about?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Fairtalian guard 1">There was no mistake,</q> the guard
    insisted. <q ab:speaker="Fairtalian guard 1">I recognized Barbalan but
    allowed her to go because of your edict. I assumed all was in good
    order. There are others who will confirm what I say.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike slammed his fist on the table and a cloud of dust rose. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Where is she, Barbalan?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    For the first time since Paddelack had known her, he thought he saw
    Barbalan frightened. Why he was so sure, he could not say. Perhaps she
    stepped back a centimeter at Pike's scream; perhaps her hand quivered
    slightly. Perhaps the first <em ab:speaker="Barbalan">I</em> of her
    response was hesitant. She controlled her fear well, as always, as all
    Gostum did. But she <em>was</em> frightened.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I don't know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike's eyes grew to twice their normal size and then narrowed to the
    narrowest of slits. Stringer stood motionless as Pike walked slowly over to
    Barbalan, put his hand across her throat, and began to strangle her. She
    made no motion to stop him and no motion to give him the information he
    wanted. Stringer began to understand what it was to be a Gostum, or what it
    was to be Barbalan. She would die first before she ceded anything. And she
    was dying. Her knees began to sink to the floor, and her face,
    chameleonlike, was turning horrible colors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack looked about desperately, not knowing what to do. His legs and
    arms were paralyzed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer could not bear it any longer. He ran forward and grabbed Pike's
    arm, slamming him backhanded across the face with all his strength. Pike
    reeled, and Stringer was immediately surrounded by other Gostum. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">We took her to Triesk! Let Barbalan go!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike stepped back. Stringer wrenched himself free from his restrainers and
    knelt by Barbalan. Her breathing was faint and irregular. He held her
    close, pressing her head to his chest and glaring at Pike. If his kalan had
    been near, it would now be resting in the Commander's throat.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You helped her?</q> Pike asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer did not move a millimeter, only ran his fingers through Barbalan's
    hair and kissed her forehead. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Forgive me,</q> he
    whispered to her. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes,</q> he said aloud.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And you?</q> Pike asked, turning to his left.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">All three.</q> Valyavar nodded.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">If you hadn't once been my friends, I'd have you
    executed on the spot. As it is, I'll just have to put you away until I
    decide what to do with you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Out of the Bannk and into the Patra,</q> Valyavar
    muttered as they were led away.
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Twenty-Nine</div>To the
  Underworld</h2>

  <p>
    Darkness itself was a welcome thing in the Bannk, especially the Killer
    Bannk; that in itself was untroublesome. It was also cooler than in the
    other places they had been so far; that also was welcome, more so than the
    darkness. What bothered Stringer and Valyavar was the heavy lock on the
    iron door of the cell and the thought of who had put them on the inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">He's not the same person,</q> Stringer mumbled.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I think, perhaps, that he has become what he
    always was,</q> Valyavar said quietly. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">But if that
    isn't the same person, I expect the same is true of all of us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Except you. You were always perfect. I don't think
    I've ever seen you lift a hand against anyone, except once, for my
    protection. You don't need to, I suppose; you seem to understand everyone
    so well—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Sometimes my understanding is to be pressed,
    that's for truth.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you understand Pike, then? Does he really
    believe what he is telling us?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">It is not clear, I'd think, that he knows what he
    believes any more.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm not sure what I believe any more, either. My
    arguments were almost as weak as his.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Is it to be expected that myths obey arguments?
    I'd not trouble myself about Polkraitz.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Valyavar is right,</q> Barbalan interrupted
    them. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Who cares about the Polkraitz? We are living
    in the present, not a thousand Patras ago. Now be silent and let me
    sleep. We'll be not good to each other unless rested.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">This is truly the Edge,</q> Stringer muttered, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">truly the Edge.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Another long silence ensued, another in a long chain of silences. It was
    hard to find things to talk about. Eventually the three looked up at the
    sound of a key rattling in the lock. Food, finally. The door opened and
    several sacks were thrown in, followed by a Gostum boot and then a guard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar and Stringer picked up the food, not recognizing the sacks as
    their own.
  </p>

  <p>
    The guard was silhouetted against the light from the small opening in the
    cell, and Stringer could not see his face. <q ab:speaker="Tjenen
    exile">Take these,</q> the guard said. <q ab:speaker="Tjenen
    exile">Barbalan will know what to do with them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What are you talking about? Who are you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Tjenen exile">Do you not remember me, Alien?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I can hardly even see you, let alone remember
    you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Tjenen exile">You saved my life once, at Triesk, near the
    beginning of the Patra.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The exile! Then you <em>were</em> a spy for the
    Gostum!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Tjenen exile">An unfortunate one. Originally a Tjenen, of
    course, not even a Fairtalian to know how to use the stala. Quite
    expendable. But yes, a spy whose information has proved useful. Your help
    was appreciated. Without it, the information would have been lost. However,
    I am not yet so much Gostum that I do not appreciate help. No one will
    follow you where you are going. Good luck.</q> The door closed, leaving
    only silence, the silence that is always the victor in the end.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I was wrong,</q> Stringer mused.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">About what?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I saved a man's life once. I was wrong.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Did you save him because he was a traitor?</q>
    Valyavar asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, I hardly believed in the Gostum. I saved him
    because he was dying.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">So, you're as right as can be hoped for in such a
    situation. Don't fret because you can't have everything. To go?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The door was unlocked and they quietly slid out. Stringer handed the keys
    over the Barbalan. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">He said you'd know what to do
    with these.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">This way. Come! You're as slow as the sun!</q>
    Barbalan led the way down the passage, suddenly ducking into a room on the
    right. The men heard a muffled groan, a soft crunch, then Barbalan returned
    with bloodied hands and several coils of rope. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Who
    knows how the road will be?</q> She shrugged as she set off down the maze
    again. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">There,</q> she said finally.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ancient door opened with difficulty. The ledge onto which it opened was
    narrow, and the path that led away from it was even narrower. It was a long
    way down, Stringer saw as he surveyed the vast desert beneath them. But it
    was even farther upward, and the path was soon lost in the heights.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Don't worry,</q> Barbalan said. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">I think we are going over one of the lower ones. Only
    eight kilometers high, or nine, which means only four or five from
    here. And there is an old village waiting at the other end at which we may
    be able to rest.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Eight or nine kilometers! How will we breathe?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">With our lungs.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Pike and his advisors were still in the great hall some telclads later when
    a frightened guard announced that the prisoners had somehow escaped.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Do you know where they are?</q> Pike asked, already
    expecting the answer that he received.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard">No. Otherwise we would have caught them and
    not disturbed you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike thought a moment. <q ab:speaker="Pike">All right. It doesn't
    matter. Just guard the stala and make sure they don't get there. After all,
    without the stala where can they go?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack had been sitting voicelessly since Stringer and Valyavar and
    Barbalan had been taken away. Occasionally he would rub his bird-beaked
    nose, but he did not enter the discussion. After the guard left he stood
    up. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I think I should go back to Massarat to check
    on the new arrivals.</q> Paddelack hoped his heartbeat didn't reveal itself
    as he waited for Pike's approval.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, that is a good idea.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    His legs wanted to run, but Paddelack held them in check until he was out
    of the room. He did not, however, go to the lift but turned to the ancient
    guard cells after stopping briefly at his room. As was to be expected, the
    guard was at his post. Paddelack pushed past him and walked down the
    corridor to the empty cell. The door was in perfect condition. He spun
    around to the guard, hand on his graser. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Where
    are they?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The guard shook his head.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">If you don't tell me, I'll blast a hole through
    your face so fast that you won't even have time to bleed.</q> Paddelack
    demonstrated his skill on the nearest wall, but the guard shook his head
    again.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Tjenen exile">I'm not going to tell you anything.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack decided to change his tactics. <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Look,
    man, if I had my head on straight, I would have let them out myself, but
    I've been pretty slow on decisions. <em>They</em> know what this is all
    about. <em>I've</em> got to follow them. Do you understand? I will
    <em>not</em> sell my soul to that man. No. You must help. It's still not
    too late for me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Tjenen exile">Over the old pass.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">When?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Tjenen exile">Ten telclads ago, maybe more.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack didn't need to be told anything else. He hurriedly collected his
    things together: his hat, graser, an old telescope he used to carry on
    expeditions, and some food. He shoved it all in his pack and departed
    without another glance. He climbed, as if possessed, for nearly half a
    beclad. <span ab:speaker="Paddelack">Now we will get to the bottom of this
    planet</span>, he thought. <span ab:speaker="Paddelack">Now I will be able
    to get off.</span> He peeled layer after layer of skin from his cheeks,
    which had become sunburned during the climb. It seemed that he peeled off
    newly burned skin every telclad, the sun's rays were so effective at this
    altitude above many of the clouds.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few small shrubs and a gray-green lichen clinging precariously to the
    rocks did their best to survive in the crevices, soaking up what little
    moisture was deposited at this height. It was not a place for living,
    despite the comfortably cool air that was such an attraction during the
    Killer Bannk.
  </p>

  <p>
    So when he was met by a party of three people as he neared the top of the
    mountain, his surprise was great. They weren't Stringer and Barbalan and
    Valyavar. Who else could be up here? As Paddelack drew nearer, the faces
    became familiar. He knew these people. They waved him on, and he summoned
    the last of his energy to meet them at the top. Then he saw the old
    settlement buried among the rocks and froze in his tracks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Furious activity was evident. Bamboo-tree wood was being dragged up the
    side of the mountain on an elaborate pulley-and-rope mechanism. Buildings
    were being repaired and new ones were under construction.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">What are you doing?</q> Paddelack cried in
    despair.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Liddlefuran settler">When we left Massarat and descended into
    the great underground plain, we brought food and all our possessions but we
    still did not know where we would go. When we finally emerged, we knew we
    were saved. The old settlement was a few beclads' walk under the sun but we
    knew we were all right. What is wrong, Paddelack? You saved us all.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack stared at his old friends who gathered about him. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Oh, God, Sarek. Jedoval, is this one of your jokes?
    Don't you understand that you will die up here during the Patra?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The blank expressions that greeted his outcry were enough of an answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">There won't be any air. You'll all suffocate. You
    have to go somewhere else.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Liddlefuran settler">Where? Where is there to go?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Down. Underground again. That is the only
    place.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Liddlefuran settler">No. The Bannk is shortening now,
    Paddelack. No one will go Under again, waiting for the Fear to strike at
    any time. We have found a good home, Paddelack, and here we will stay. We
    are tired of running.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">No. It's suicide to stay up here. You must go
    down and take all the food and supplies with you. Believe me; if you don't,
    you will all die.</q> Paddelack knew he wasn't absolutely sure of that
    statement, was not absolutely sure the atmosphere would collapse during the
    Short Patra ahead. No one really knew how cold it became. Maybe he was
    mistaken about the principle, but this was not the kind of principle to
    test by oneself.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Liddlefuran settler">How can we live on the underground plain?
    There is nothing there.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">I don't know but you'll have to. I can't help
    you.</q> Paddelack's eyes darted down the road toward the east. <q
    ab:speaker="Paddelack">Tell me, did anyone else come this way earlier?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Liddlefuran settler">Yes, you aren't the first.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Tell me quickly, where are they?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Liddlefuran settler">They rested here for a little while, and
    now Mith is taking them to the underground plain. They were very anxious to
    see it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack ran over to the other edge of the village and looked down the
    snaking mountain path. If he tried hard enough, he could convince himself
    that he saw three or four figures walking down the road, mere specks in the
    distance. Tears came to his eyes, choking in his throat. He looked
    frantically from the path to the settlement and back again. He took a step
    down, then halted and backed up. He began shaking and shivering. To
    understand Patra-Bannk after such a long wait, for now he was sure he was
    so close to the answer. Or to follow these people and be given another
    chance at the life that had been lost to him more than twenty Patra-Bannks
    earlier.…He took another step down but halted a second time. No. He shook
    his head finally. He owed the Liddlefurans everything. They had cared for
    him for all those twenty-odd Patra-Bannks. How could he desert them now?
    No. Finally a decision was clear to him, perhaps the first decision of his
    life that was, in the end, clear. Paddelack turned back to the
    settlement. He would not follow this Bannk, if he ever followed at all.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    When the boy Mith led them down the stairwell, what they saw didn't seem
    much more than what it was, a peculiarly shaped building sitting
    conspicuously in the middle of nowhere, entangled in the profuse but
    transient growths of the longest Bannk.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">So, I think this journey is not over yet,</q>
    Barbalan said when she saw it. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">There is still
    hope.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Where can it take us other than down?</q> Stringer
    asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">What is in my mind,</q> Barbalan replied, <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">is that there are many shafts like this, and at the
    bottom of each there will be a way to get to the nearest stala.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How do you know?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Neberdjer told me. Now come on.</q> They thanked
    Mith for showing them the way and entered the building. Barbalan found an
    elevator, as if she knew what she was looking for, and they descended. At
    the bottom was a deserted concourse littered with debris and human waste
    from the caravan that had recently come by. Stringer could understand why
    the boy had called it a plain. It stretched on and on until the number of
    occasional rooms that interrupted the line of sight blocked off further
    vision.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan set about searching a nearby wall, as she had been instructed to
    do in such a situation. When she found the spot marked on the wall, she
    spoke aloud. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">It's Barbalan. I want to go to
    Neberdjer.</q> Very soon a car glided along the center of the concourse,
    hovering over the floor. They climbed into the streamlined vehicle and we
    whisked away.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Twould seem the planet is made for traveling.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Exactly,</q> Barbalan said.
  </p>

  <p>
    They came to rest not a telclad later, and Stringer hopped out after
    Barbalan. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you know where we are?</q> he asked,
    surveying a scene that, as far as he could tell, was identical to the one
    they had just left.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">From what I was told, we should be below the
    Konndjlan stala.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But surely the Gostum are swarming around up
    there. I don't want to risk capture. If we are caught, that's the end of
    everything.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Neberdjer said each stala has below it—look!</q>
    Barbalan ran around a bend in the concourse. Stringer squinted. Rockets!
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Can we take one?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Myself, I do not know how they work. But I think
    Neberdjer will take care of that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Then he must be our patron saint,</q> Valyavar
    added.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer smiled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Okay, let's go.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Their footsteps echoed as they ran down the concourse and up the
    entranceway. As soon as they entered the lights went on. Valyavar secured
    the hatch and immediately thereafter they began moving. Neberdjer was
    indeed aware of their presence.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Barbalan, can you say where we are going?</q>
    Valyavar asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">To Neberdjer, the central controls of this
    planet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Central controls?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">That is what I was told. I don't understand any of
    that, I am afraid. That is one reason I was told to bring you, so you could
    use the controls. But it is far away, I think. On something called the line
    that divides the planet in two.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">On the equator!</q> Stringer exclaimed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I don't know what an equator is,</q> Barbalan
    said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No time to explain now. We'll roast alive! Surely
    it is too hot in the tropics to survive at all. Valyavar, do you think we
    can turn this ship around?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar didn't even bother to stand up. He remained stretched out on his
    couch. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Now, Stringer, first of all, as a day and a
    year on this planet aren't to be easily distinguished, I'm not sure that
    tropics exist from one year to the next. Where the sun happens to be
    overhead is tropics. Who's to say it is any hotter down there than here?
    Besides, if it was to be possible, where would we go? Where are we now?
    Whose ship are we in? 'Tseems worth finding out, and if Neberdjer is where
    we are going to find out, that's where we should go. You do want to find
    out, don't you, Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes.</q> Stringer nodded sharply. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">It is time to get some answers.</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Thirty</div>Two Problems</h2>

  <p>
    Taljen helped unload the wood from the boat and piled it up on the
    dock. When she finished, she quickly slipped under the canopy that had been
    erected and sat down. As she drank her ration of water she shook her
    head. Normally no one would be out this teclad of the Killer Bannk. It was
    much too hot for that. But the Golun-Patra had changed things; nothing was
    right since then. Now wood had to be transported from down the coast. After
    the fire there was little enough here, and to get wood required being
    partners with the sun and the murky clouds. The short shifts did little to
    cut the number of people who died from exposure. Taljen finished her drink
    and returned to work. Soon, the last log thrown in, another cart was
    loaded, and Taljen made a note of it on her checklist. The paper was so
    damp that it ripped as she wrote on it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Let's go, grask, and get out of the sun. It will
    kill us all soon.</q> She whipped the animal awake and the cart began to
    lumber up the road from the beach, only to get stuck in a rut. As Taljen
    struggled with the wheel she heard a voice calling to her.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Let me help with that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen looked between two logs up over the far side of the cart, and saw
    Benjfold walking toward her. He hesitated visibly as he recognized who was
    on the other side of the cart, but he did not halt. Taljen had not seen him
    since her return. She managed a faint smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Hello, Benjfold, Old Nesta.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Hello, Taljen. I hear that you returned
    recently.</q> Benjfold bent to the immobile wagon and shoved with Taljen,
    arms glistening. <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Are you glad to be back?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I don't know, Benjfold. I didn't
    expect Ta-tjenen to have changed so much.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">It hasn't changed at all, as far as I can see.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The cart rocked back and forth until its momentum finally carried it out of
    the rut.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I suppose, Benjfold Who Collects Trees, there is
    that, too.</q> Taljen pulled the grask gently by the hair toward the road.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">The fire last Bannk has put us in more than a
    precarious position,</q> Benjfold said, trying to make conversation. <q
    ab:speaker="Benjfold">There is little enough here. Charcoal for
    heating.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">There is little here, that is truthful, but there is
    less south, where it is hotter. We are lucky in that…But are we lucky
    enough to get through the Patra?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">We will get through this Patra, with the Time
    Keeper's help. After that, I don't know—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">The next is a Long Patra, is it not?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Benjfold nodded. <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">But it is a long way away—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Only a Weird Bannk separates the two.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">You are not very optimistic.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I don't deceive myself any longer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">This is not the Taljen I once had for a nesta. You
    are beginning to sound like the Alien.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">There may be that, too. But he is gone, far away
    with the Gostum. Very far away.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">With the Gostum, you tell me? Then he is
    Polkraitz, as we always suspected.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen sighed and lowered her head. Her hair fell in front of her eyes,
    hiding her face from view. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">He may be that, who
    knows?</q> she said almost inaudibly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">After the way you mysteriously returned, is there
    any doubt? Either your story of distant travels is a myth, Taljen, or the
    way back is clearly a Polkraitz miracle.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Clearly. That must be true, mustn't it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Well, as long as that Alien Polkraitz stays far
    away with his own kind, we will be safe from the likes of him.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Safe. I do not think we will be seeing Stringer
    again, Fearful Benjfold. Ta-tjenen does not figure very highly in his
    world.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Good…Have you thought about a new nesta?</q>
    Benjfold asked, trying to change the subject.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No. I have not thought about it at all. I still have
    a Patra-Bannk yet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">You were not asked to get a replacement?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I have not been asked anything by anyone.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">That strikes me as not being ordinary.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Benjfold,</q> Taljen finally said, <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">I want to be alone.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Her old nesta nodded sharply. <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">All right, if you
    persist in acting this way, fine. I won't bother you anymore. Good-bye,
    Taljen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Good-bye, Benjfold,</q> she replied without any
    trace of a smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    Benjfold went off to the docks, Taljen to the town. The road was bleached
    white, stifling white, saturated with heat. Everything seemed saturated
    with heat. Taljen walked quickly. After leaving the wood at a storehouse,
    she went to see Alhane. He usually had something interesting for her to do,
    and she had not seen him since the meeting upon her return. A visit was
    long overdue.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, as she was cutting across the edge of the deserted park, she
    met Kenken Wer. Taljen had avoided the old woman in the beclads since her
    return, but a close-knit town of twenty thousand is not a big place when
    you are trying to hide from someone. No doubt Kenken Wer was on her way to
    the nestrexam to see to some business.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Kenken Wer, with her Bannk-darkened, splotchy face and her short hair,
    stood before Taljen on the shriveled fern-moss of the park. Kenken Wer had
    always like Taljen, however erratic her behavior had been since the return
    of the Polkraitz Alien. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">I've heard of you,
    Taljen Returned.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes, I'm back,</q> Taljen said, looking away,
    brushing back her cowl.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">How far did you travel? No one has told me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Very far.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Did the Alien desert you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen stammered and shook her head.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Tell me, although I am in a hurry, how you got
    back.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I don't know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Ah, well, Taljen,</q> Kenken Wer sighed. <q
    ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">I hope you learned something from your journey.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly Taljen gazed straight into Kenken Wer's eyes. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">You were wrong about everything!</q> she screamed as
    she ran away. What Kenken Wer didn't catch was Taljen's last sigh: <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">And you were right about everything, too.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Taljen was surprised to find Alhane snoring loudly, slumped over his
    desk. It was not so much his snoring that bothered her, but the fact that
    he was working himself harder and harder until he now fell asleep at his
    desk, out of phase of his usual habits and assistants. She shook his
    head. He snorted. She shook it again and he wheezed and coughed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What is it?</q> he squeaked. Then he jerked himself
    erect and remembered his papers. He picked up a sheet of calculations,
    studied it for a moment, and threw it down. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Ah, it
    is a straitjacket! Nothing works, only gets tied up in knots.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Still no success?</q> Taljen queried.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No, not anything, nor as much as a ray of sun in the
    Patra, I thank you.</q> Alhane sighed deeply. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And I
    don't even know what I'm looking for. I'm just groping in the dark for
    something that makes sense, something that is pleasing to the eye. Do these
    convoluted orbits look pleasing to you? Only Verlaxchi would have made the
    world so ugly to look at. I don't believe it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Well,</q> Taljen said, <q ab:speaker="Taljen">as I
    told you once before, you can always try it with the sun in the middle.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane got up and shook his head at Taljen. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you
    think, Bitter Girl, that it is so simple to throw away everything that is
    so obvious to the eye and to the spirit?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Why not?</q> Taljen asked with a raised eyebrow and
    a distinct rise in pitch of her voice. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You decided
    the world was a ball, didn't you? You seemed easy about that. Why is it so
    different now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It isn't the same,</q> Alhane answered sadly. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">There at least I had something: some data to go on,
    some similarities in the way the sun looked—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What was that data? It is not clear even now,
    Alhane, that your data was good. The smallest tilt of the pole—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But it was something, and I still believe it. And
    now that you have been south, you believe it, too, don't you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Reluctantly Taljen nodded. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">So what is the
    problem?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What is the problem, indeed? My children say the
    same thing. <q>Why do you have such trouble trying it the other way? If you
    don't, we will.</q> Indeed, where is the problem? Where is anything? What
    do I have to go on? I have no intuition as to what things should look
    like. Should the orbits be circles? That seems likely, but since I have
    only recently found out what an orbit is, what prevents them from being
    squares? Does the force forbid it? I have only the vaguest idea of what a
    force can do. Can the orbits be overlaid? Then in two dimensions or
    three?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You will have to try them all, I suppose—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And see which ones fit the observations. Yes, I
    know.</q> Alhane began pacing the room. He paced for a long time to the
    tune of his mistuned clocks. Finally he broke his stride; his forehead
    glistened with perspiration that had not been there earlier. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">All right, I'll try it. I have no reason to, but I will
    try it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You have the best reason to try it,</q> Taljen said
    with a distinct sneer in her voice. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer said it
    was that way, didn't he?</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Thirty-One</div>In the Realm of
  the Gods</h2>

  <p>
    Where or when the journey had ended, Stringer wasn't sure, but ended it
    had; and at the end, after telclads of darkness and constant acceleration,
    Stringer had seen lights ahead. The acceleration turned to deceleration and
    the ship silently glided into its berth. Barbalan did not wait a clad
    before she opened the hatch and bounded down the gangway. Stringer had time
    only to glimpse the rows of docked ships before Barbalan pressed her
    companions to the surface.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sun appeared above their heads, a small coronaless ball, seen through
    thick clouds. Stringer wanted to dart for cover, never wanting to see that
    sun again. But he didn't start sweating or immediately feel nauseous. It
    was comfortable. They were in an enclosed area, a giant park, perhaps.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Is this Daryephna?</q> Stringer asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">No, definitely not. I assume this is
    Neberdjer.</q> Barbalan trotted off to a nearby road, inset a few
    centimeters into the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">She seems to know what she's up to,</q> Valyavar
    remarked as he slung his sack over his shoulder and followed her.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">As always,</q> Stringer added.
  </p>

  <p>
    A car awaited them. Barbalan climbed into the open vehicle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar cocked an eye at Stringer. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Tseems our
    journey has the cooperation of the entire planet. To go?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm not sure I like this,</q> Stringer said,
    glancing at Barbalan, who stood waiting for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan took his hand in hers and helped him up. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">And I'm not sure, Stringer, that it matters whether
    we like it or not.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They had only a brief glimpse of the city as the car sped to its
    destination. Kilometers of buildings piled within buildings, buildings
    overhanging buildings, towers and formless blobs flashed by before the car
    stopped.
  </p>

  <p>
    A yellow archway beckoned clearly. Its four freestanding hyperbolas each
    facing another betrayed a mathematical imagination. In its middle was a
    stairwell which Barbalan bounded down in a clad. The cross section of the
    stairwell was an ellipse, Stringer realized as he peered down the many
    levels to the bottom. Barbalan got off at the top level. Stringer and
    Valyavar followed and found themselves in a chamber whose wall traced out
    the intersection of many conic sections. The resulting curve, part ellipse,
    part hyperbola and parabola, was as perfect as the geometry on which it was
    based. A lounge splayed around the central staircase. The walls were mostly
    blank, but colors and textures ran from the simple to the complex and
    seemed to shift continuously. A row of strange-looking chairs lined one of
    the nearer walls, and before each chair was a simple desk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan grabbed Stringer by the shoulders and sat him down in one of the
    chairs, which immediately adjusted itself to his form. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">Here you are. You are here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly Stringer was paralyzed. A voice speaking in pure Bitter reached up
    to him from the depths of his brain. <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I am glad to
    see that Barbalan followed my direction and brought you here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you know her?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Everything about her. She taught me her language,
    or rather, I should say that I used her to learn her language. From my few
    experiences with others, I would guess that she is highly intelligent, but
    not the one I need. Her educational and cultural background is not
    sufficient for her to understand what needs to be done. Her vocabulary does
    not even have the necessary symbols. Pike will not help. I hope you are the
    one I need. You must repair the stability control mechanism for this
    planet. It is urgent.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The what?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">The stability control mechanism. The centering
    system. You do not understand?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No. Why don't you tell me who you are?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Me? I am Neberdjer. I run this set of
    differential equations—ah, this planet, if it exists.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer blinked. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Are you Polkraitz?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">We all are. I am, you are.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I am?</q> Stringer sighed. Wasn't there any escape
    from these Polkraitz? <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why do you think I am
    Polkraitz?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I met a group of them about ten-to-the-nineteenth
    light meters ago. They were very much like you—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Wait a minute. What do you mean, light meters ago?
    A meter is a distance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Ahh,</q> Neberdjer sighed, if that sound could be
    called a sigh. <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">An unfortunate distortion of the
    nature of things causes you to perceive the Universe to be divided into
    space and time, when in reality they are one. This sad and limiting
    distortion seems to be the result of your primitive nervous system. I am
    not so limited and live relativistically, thus perceiving the continuum
    geometrically, as it is meant to be perceived. You can measure time as you
    wish; I will measure it as it should be measured.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was beginning to understand that communication was going to be
    difficult with this being.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">But, as I was saying, this group of earlier
    Polkraitz only ran away when I tried to talk to them. I had to waylay one,
    as I did with both Pike and Barbalan, but that one left very shortly
    thereafter, <em>died</em>, I believe now. Anyway, I got very little from
    him: he agreed that there had been an accident, that the party had to leave
    to get necessary supplies and would return soon to effect the rescue. Pike
    said he was Polkraitz, so I see you have finally come back to finish your
    work.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, Stringer thought, there go a lot of theories. If one assumed that
    this Neberdjer had misunderstood the message and that the Polkraitz were to
    return to rescue fellow explorers at Ta-tjenen, then a lot of things began
    to make sense. Clearly, everyone on this planet was descended from that
    expedition—Gostum, Tjenens, everyone. Evidently some accident had occurred,
    and the Polkraitz had left with the intention of rescuing those stranded
    behind but never had. From Taljen's confused story, Stringer could extract
    one useful piece of information: the war had erupted over where to place
    the Center. Stringer guessed that this really meant a split had grown over
    whether to live at Ta-tjenen or at Konndjlan while waiting for the
    return—or after having given up waiting. Whether or not this new theory was
    the correct one, Stringer couldn't be sure, but at least it didn't seem to
    contradict any of the available evidence. Perhaps, in the end, Barbalan's
    remark made in the darkness of their cell at Konndjlan was the most
    sensible: <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Who cares?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Now, Polkraitz,</q> Neberdjer asked, interrupting
    Stringer's thoughts, <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">why don't you tell me if you
    really exist? Who are you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Stringer—and I'm not Polkraitz.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">You must be. You are here for the rescue, the
    repair.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer desperately wanted to know what this was all about, but he
    couldn't think of what to ask first. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How are you
    talking to me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer" class="no-close-quote">I am simply bypassing your
    outer ear, directly stimulating your auditory nerves and speaking to you in
    your own language. Previously, as with the earlier Polkraitz, I would talk
    on a very basic, subliminal level. I would manipulate the fundamental
    chemical and physical reactions in your brain that eventually become
    thoughts in your mind. I see now that this method requires a lot of
    energy. Twice now, I have tried to contact an entire group of humanoids in
    this fashion. The energy expended in getting the signal out was trivial,
    but the few who heard it only ran away. They were of no help
    whatsoever. The rest seem to have a built-in block to the reception,
    undoubtedly due to faulty instruction.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer" class="no-close-quote">In dealing with Barbalan,
    the first person with whom I had more than a momentary contact, thus
    allowing some data-collection time, I found that a reduced energy level
    facilitated communication. Pike was the last I tried to contact this way,
    and with him I used the parameters tested on Barbalan. However, the correct
    energy input is evidently a critical function varying from individual to
    individual, and I misjudged. I don't think Pike enjoyed the experience.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">In any event, that is all in the past, and now
    that I know Bitter, I am talking to you as you talk to another human,
    except that I am bypassing the inefficient input stages. If you wish, we can
    proceed audibly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">This is all right, I guess,</q> Stringer
    replied. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So you are aware that people are coming
    into the city, here and at Daryephna, and using your transportation
    system?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Aware. I am still not sure what that concept
    means. To believe that I am not the only being in the Universe is a
    difficult proposition. Once I suspected that others existed, at least in
    equational form, and that they evidently were acting independently of
    myself, I recalled that I had constructed certain <q>communication
    devices</q> such as the call box through which Barbalan recently spoke to
    me. Thus, granting the independence of these other beings, it
    immediately—instantaneously, by your clumsy nervous system's
    standards—occurred to me that communication was a <q>physical</q>
    possibility. Up to that time it had remained an abstraction, since I had
    never actually communicated with anything before. The next question was
    whether it was useful to try to communicate. After a long and instantaneous
    debate, I decided to try communicating. But my language is totally alien,
    completely mathematical, so the humanoids didn't even realize I was trying
    to talk to them and completely misunderstood the message. Barbalan was the
    first exception. From talking to her, I learned that I must keep energy
    levels to a minimum.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Surely you must have guessed that the facilities
    on this planet were built for some sort of people. In fact, I don't
    understand why you didn't know that to begin with.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Why do you say <q>surely</q>? If you were brought
    up in a black room from the moment of your birth, would you ever suspect
    anything was beyond it? Once, after a great stretch of the imagination, I
    did posit the actual existence of something else, such as this planet, or
    you humans, but still treated them as mere fictions, analogous to the
    concept of a mathematical point, useful to explain certain concepts but
    which has no real existence.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer wasn't sure he liked being considered a mathematical concept.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">After all, I get certain inputs used to solve
    certain equations. That is all. Why assume there is anything more to it? I
    have no memory of any previous Neberdjer meeting a people, and the
    observations can be explained just as easily without them. There is no
    reason to introduce such extraneous variables into the Universe. The
    equations are given. The rest is speculation.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head, subliminally. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't
    understand. What are you? Are you alive?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I am Neberdjer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Where did you come from?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">The previous Neberdjer. You may say that I am a
    mutation, an improvement, a replication of the last Neberdjer,
    incorporating those parts of that being which it saw fit to include in the
    present one.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What about the previous Neberdjer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I come from a long line of Neberdjers,
    continually mutating. Record of the first Neberdjer is nonexistent.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Certainly the first must have come from
    somewhere.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Why?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Everything has a beginning.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">How do you know? Where did the first humans come
    from?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Perhaps everything you have experienced has a
    beginning and an end, but have you ever seen an atom created? Or, more
    accurately, a quantum of space-time? Remaining with the atom for
    illustrative purposes, do you assume an atom will end? Why do you assume it
    began? It seem to me a <q>human</q> problem, if I may use the term, and not
    necessarily a logical one. To posit the existence of a creator is clearly
    unfounded. Such speculations about origins only lead to infinite
    regress.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Enough!</q> Stringer yelled, if he was yelling at
    all. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What do you do here?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I have been solving differential equations. If
    you are going to attach meanings to the equations, then I would say I have
    been building and activating the mechanisms on this planet for the last
    ten-to-the-twenty-second light meters, which is why you find some things in
    working order.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Which is why the transportation system can be
    used.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Correct.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You haven't stopped anyone from using it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Why should I? Once I discovered <q>aliens</q> and
    decided to try communication, the closing of the transportation network
    would have been a contradiction. The results, as I have said, are
    discouraging, especially because it was immediately clear to me why the
    Polkraitz, yourself included, were here to begin with.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And why is that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">The <q>emergency,</q> as you would call it. The
    first problem that I have ever had that was not <q>expected.</q> That is
    why you are here. The Polkraitz indicated they were aware of the
    emergency.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What emergency?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I told you, you must repair the centering
    mechanism or the entire planet will be destroyed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And I told you that I didn't know what you were
    talking about.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">This is odd. To keep the supercondensed body that
    lies at the center of the planet <em>in</em> the center.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What supercondensed body?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">The supercondensed body. Sometimes, when extra
    energy is needed, it is a naked singularity. But right now it is slowed
    down enough so that it is a black hole.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer gulped. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't know much about black
    holes except barroom talk and nothing about stability controls or centering
    systems, so I think you'd better use one of your own repair mechanisms to
    fix it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Don't you understand yet?</q> came the voice. <q
    ab:speaker="Neberdjer">You are the repair mechanism.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Consider: I have never had an emergency, am not
    aware that other life exists. The two discoveries coincide. Furthermore,
    the Polkraitz said they were here because of an accident, said they will
    return for the rescue. Pike tells me you are Polkraitz. The conclusion is
    clear: you are here to effect the repairs, and something has gone wrong
    with your instructions.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Who gave us the instructions?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">As I am the only being on this planet, I must
    have a part of me with which I am not in direct communication, a fail-safe
    mechanism, you call it. It is easier than believing you exist totally
    independent of me. All I said, we are all Polkraitz.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Couldn't all those happenings have been
    coincidence?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Coincidence? What is a coincidence?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Never mind.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Then I suggest you get to the repairs right
    away.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan and Valyavar saw Stringer rise slowly and drag his feet over to a
    hidden alcove in the wall. He returned with some bread, cheese, and kob
    and distributed it among the three of them. Barbalan and Valyavar ate
    hungrily; Stringer nibbled. Unexpectedly he began to laugh, first a slight
    shake of the head, then a soft chuckle, finally hysterical screaming.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Stringer!</q> Valyavar shouted when he could stand
    it no longer. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Sarek, what's wrong with you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer tried to speak between gales of laughter. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">What a joke! A colossal joke! Cosmic repairmen,
    that's what we are. We're here to fix a planet. Valyavar, years ago you
    told me that I was coming to Hendig's World to find God. Well, here it
    is. And what a God! It couldn't make repairmen. Our creator. We're robots
    made of flesh and blood. Programmed to fix this planet. But something went
    wrong. Can you imagine? You, me, Pike, Hendig, all unreal creations—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">How can you say that?</q> Barbalan shouted. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">What evidence do you have?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Because it is true. Those dreams, as if someone
    were trying to talk to me and I didn't quite get the signal. It was
    Neberdjer trying to get me to—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Stringer, that's crazy! Stop it, will you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm not finished. I learned Tjenen incredibly
    fast, and my leg healed, and I figured out that the planet was artificial,
    and I learned to play the rodoft; I picked everything up like a fish taking
    to water. It was all <em>supposed</em> to be, programmed. For all I know,
    our pasts were made up by that thing with a warped mind. Two-Bit! It
    probably doesn't even exist. How could a planet with a name like Two-Bit
    exist? Even the Polkraitz were made up, and we are Polkraitz. My past, all
    our pasts, phony—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan angrily threw down her food. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Even if
    that's true—and you certainly haven't convinced me that it is—what
    difference can it make? The past is just a memory, anyway, whether real or
    implanted. There is no way of telling the difference.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But then my life has been a dream and not a real
    life—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Stringer, that is the stupidest thing I have ever
    heard.</q> Barbalan had lost all patience. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">Programmed or not, only a real person could act the
    way you do. Now shut up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer clamped his mouth shut. He snorted and laughed, but this time the
    laugh was directed at himself. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, you may have
    something there.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Only now did Barbalan remember her own odyssey to Daryephna, how she had
    been intensely curious after hearing Paddelack's stories, how she had felt
    driven to the city. And only now did she remember about the ship Pike and
    Paddelack had found, the one they had told her was too familiar to their
    own for comfort. Barbalan paused to wonder if she had spoken too hastily,
    but she was not going to bring up the matter again. After all, the past
    <em>was</em> just a memory, and there was no way of telling the difference,
    real or imagined.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar also had his thoughts, which he voiced with a low chuckle as he
    leaned back on the couch. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar"
    class="no-close-quote">Ah, little Stringer, your reaction strikes me akin to
    an old acquaintance of mine who, after surviving no less than six strokes
    of lightning, became an evangelist, claiming that he was the Blessed, and
    began preaching The Way.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Or, if you will allow me to continue, I am
    reminded of a scene I was once privileged to witness in a dingy flophouse
    over the Transhi. I was peaceably stroking my beard when I chanced to
    overhear a fragment of a conversation being held next to me. Two gentlemen,
    to forgive the usage of the term, were observing the meanest scoundrel
    you'd be to imagine who was asleep in a dung heap next to the door. Now,
    I'll stake my peldram of kob that this little vermin, young enough to be
    your son, was the same who soon afterward appeared as the great Geerha Pan,
    who attracted millions with his disgusting and august dispersions. After
    much debate among themselves, the two men woke the boy up, discoursed with
    him at length, then let him to slumber once more. They took a long look at
    the reclining figure, toasted each other with teeth shining, and one said
    to the other in a truly unsalubrious voice that sent shivers up my spine,
    <q>You know, if they'll buy this, they'll buy anything.</q></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer laughed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But those dreams and the Fear;
    how do you explain—? Oh, I guess Neberdjer wasn't sure. Maybe the being
    will have better luck with you two. Why don't you talk to it?</q> Stringer
    sat his friends down at the desk and left the room. He walked briefly
    outside on the street until he found an open area complete with small blue
    hillocks and red vegetation. Lying on his back, he could see the sun
    occasionally, unsuccessfully trying to break through the thick clouds of
    water vapor that were themselves dulled in color by the tinted
    enclosure. Stringer was grateful for that. It was the first time in many
    teclads that he had looked at the sun without anger rising in his throat.
  </p>

  <p>
    A tug on his arm woke him. It was Barbalan.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">It is a strange being that dwells here,</q> she
    said. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I am expected to know much, I think, and
    Neberdjer is disappointed in the reality. But I also suspect that it is
    friendly, and I am not afraid of retribution.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, I think that we are going to have to do this
    job the hard way,</q> Stringer agreed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I couldn't
    even fix a shuttlecraft; how does Neberdjer expect me to fix a planet?</q>
    He uprooted a small maroon plant and gave it to Barbalan. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">In thanks for your arguments earlier.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">What?</q> She smiled, taking it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I…I think, for perhaps the first time, you made me
    feel as if my life was important.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I hope I didn't make you feel that. Feeling too
    important is dangerous.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I mean, you made me feel as if being alive was
    worth something after all, for its own sake. I'm not sure anything I've
    ever done has really shown that staying alive meant anything to me. When I
    was fighting Ta-tjenen to stay alive, I think it was more for spite than
    because I really cared for my own life. When I kill with the kalan, it is
    with such joyful recklessness that I can't believe I really care whether
    I'm killed or not. Now I am beginning to feel a little
    different. Thanks.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Stringer, I have not known you long and hesitate
    to speak—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Go on.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I have only talked to Taljen and have only seen
    your acceptance of what Neberdjer told us. I think, perhaps, that you are
    running from a history you allow to constrain you, refusing to believe in
    yourself, refusing to believe what your dreams tell you and blaming them
    instead on something else. Rely on your dreams; they are your clearest
    insights into problems. And, Stringer, I will never ask you about your
    past; the past does not interest me. But please, do not run from the past,
    but run toward the future. I can offer you nothing else except long-overdue
    thanks for saving my own life, worthless as it is. Pike was doing his best
    to send me to Verlaxchi.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    If Stringer ever blushed, it was then. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I…I think
    it was the easiest thing I've ever done.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">You were risking much for a stranger.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">As a girl who risked her life for me at least
    three times in the first beclad of our meeting, you stopped being a stranger
    very quickly.</q> Stringer pulled Barbalan toward him, caressed her, and
    sought her mouth with his. She wrapped her arms around him and they stayed
    together for a very long time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">In circumstances of such great urgency, I can
    think of better things to do.</q> The mocking voice was Valyavar's. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">Come, Neberdjer wants to speak to us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Once they were inside, Neberdjer spoke to all of them, audibly this
    time. <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">The three of you seem to lack the knowledge
    that I had assumed you possessed; therefore you must be trained for the
    job. Stringer, I will try to teach you enough to have a basic understanding
    of the planetary operations. Maybe that will help you in the discovery and
    repair of the problem. Barbalan and Valyavar, I will show you how to use
    any necessary equipment you will find. The process will take up valuable
    time, but I see no way around it. So let us begin.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Wait a minute,</q> Stringer said, waving his
    hand. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why should we do this?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">The planet will be destroyed otherwise.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So what?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">A good question. To answer it requires that you
    assume that black holes, tidal forces, planets, and ourselves represent
    something other than metrics, coordinate systems, and differential
    equations. I don't know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Stringer,</q> Barbalan interrupted, <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">I think we should try to help—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Help whom?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Ourselves, if no one else. Just to do it. For our
    future.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer hesitated for a moment, gazing into Barbalan's pitch-black
    eyes. He nodded. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Okay, but, Neberdjer, can't you
    tell us anything about who lived here and why no one is here now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">No. As I have said before, all that is
    speculation. Neberdjers have been around for at least
    ten-to-the-twenty-second light meters, according to my internal sequencing
    clock, which runs automatically and is beyond my control. However, events
    in my own <q>subjective</q> memory run together and lose any time
    sequence. This phenomenon may be attributed to lack of external
    comparators, events with which to sequence time. If my clock is correct, no
    one has been here for a very long time. If memory is correct, time is
    totally subjective, all may be happening at one instant, now or in the
    past, and your question is meaningless.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Okay.</q> Stringer chuckled. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Let's get to work.</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Thirty-Two</div>Reculer Pour Mieux
  Sauter</h2>

  <p>
    The Bannk was wearing thin. Karrxlyn drilled lines of recruits on the
    plateau at Massarat. Material, often imported from the north, was being
    fashioned into bows and catapults. Karrxlyn watched the Fringemen become
    more and more proficient with their weapons. Targets were more frequently
    pierced through their bull's-eyes; fewer bolts were lost over the edge or
    shattered on the rocks. Long bows were not the favored weapons; the wind,
    now on the uptake again, played havoc with their flight. Instead,
    crossbows, which could wreak destruction as well as any gun in the hands of
    a good marksman, were substituted. Barbed tips were fashioned from odd
    pieces of metal lying about the caves themselves and in the old
    mines. Shields were difficult. Bamboo-tree wood was in short supply at
    Massarat, and material had to be imported from the more temperate north via
    the stala or constructed from the few plants found along the coast.
  </p>

  <p>
    The coast at Liddlefur had, a teclad ago, been visited for the first time
    this Bannk. The expedition came back hot, almost dead, but with a good
    catch of fish. However, the loss of life, nearly half the party, had been
    enough to convince Pike that the Killer Bannk was impossible below the
    mountains and that food should, along with almost everything else, be
    imported from the north.
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn watched the first catapult hurl its payload over the edge as the
    huge lever jerked to a halt against the crosspiece and the machine
    rebounded in a cloud of dust. After the first dozen or two engines had been
    completed, Karrxlyn was becoming satisfied, or restless, and went to find
    the Commander.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike was in council with Effrulyn on his right, holding the Angles, and
    Fara-Ny on his left. Karrxlyn bowed slightly as he entered the chamber,
    scowled at the newfangled clock, which he could not understand, and sat
    down with the others.
  </p>

  <p>
    A diagram of Triesk, which had been delivered by one of the reconnaissance
    missions, was spread across the table. Pike was pacing the room, slowly,
    evenly, without agitation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Am I interrupting?</q> Karrxlyn asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No. You have leave to say what you have to say.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">The Bannk is more than half done. Long ago it
    turned the corner in the sky. The recruits are ready, and it is my
    suggestion that we attack as soon as possible. Remember, we must now
    prepare not only for the invasion but for the coming Patra as well. And
    that Patra—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Tjenen exile">—is only a semi-infinite time away,</q>
    Effrulyn finished. <q ab:speaker="Tjenen exile">Applied, details,
    quibblers. Arrgh. Why do I get involved with things of such nature? What
    can be done about it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike smiled and waved the mathematician silent. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, I
    have been considering our position. My former and now vanished companion
    brought the news that Triesk contains more than twenty thousand
    inhabitants. This is troublesome. It exceeded your estimations. How many
    are we now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Five thousand, with more coming all the time,
    Commander.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">That is not enough. Look at these sketches. Triesk
    sits on top of a tall, steep hill. It has the advantage for defense. It
    also has four times the people we have—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">—including children and the aged.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Nonetheless, we are still outnumbered by perhaps two
    to one. And, as you rightly inform me, the Bannk is retreating. There is
    still much light left, but will we have enough to start? That is what I
    have been considering.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Do you come to any conclusions?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I suggest that we need something else?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Such as, Commander?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Surprise.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn laughed, Effrulyn fondled his Angles absently, and Fara-Ny's staff
    dropped to the floor with a wooden clatter.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Surprise in the middle of the Bannk, when it takes
    beclads to assemble the forces via the stala and your ships? That sounds
    unlikely, Commander.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Then why not attack at dawn?</q> Pike asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    Normally, Karrxlyn would have bellowed at the idiocy of such a
    suggestion. However, even the regal Karrxlyn had to admit that Pike's
    stance, sword hanging from his side and head defiant, already anticipating
    such a response, and Karrxlyn's bellow was stillborn. <q
    ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">I assume you have a plan in mind, Commander.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, I have a plan.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">But attacking at dawn assumes we are there during
    the Patra.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Exactly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Light? Heat? Food? Shelter? Where are they going
    to come from?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">My shuttles will provide the shelter while the camp is
    built—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">One cannot build during the Patra.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">I think that men can do many things when pressed. We
    will work in short shifts, use heated quazzats if necessary. We will have
    to start getting the necessary materials immediately.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">There is still the problem of light.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">My shuttles have search beams. We will make fires. On
    my planet we have spots that get very cold, too. Men can work there. It can
    be done.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Does it get as cold as the Patra?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">We will see, won't we? You asked for my Command. Now I
    have given it to you. Do you object? If not, I suggest we prepare for the
    coming darkness.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Fara-Ny nodded silently. Effrulyn looked about. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I
    can't see what difference it can possibly make; you seem to have nothing
    better to do for amusement.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn shook a fist at the blond-haired boy. <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Put
    a sword in this one's hand and I'll show him what I'd like to do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Enough,</q> Pike interposed. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Go
    tell the recruits of the delay. They will be housed here during the
    Patra—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn opened his mouth.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">We will make the room,</q> Pike continued, <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">and this ends the discussion, by my Command.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn rose brusquely, helped Fara-Ny to his feet, and together they left
    the council chamber. Effrulyn stood up but Pike silently, wearily, waved
    him down.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Yes, Commander?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Sit, just sit with me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The young man sat down, puzzled, not realizing that Pike hardly noticed
    anything now but the slow ticking of the giant clock. To Effrulyn, the
    clock was as always, monotonous and annoying. To Pike, the arm of the
    pendulum was fluid, stretching and arching as the long swing began trudging
    from the right, creeping faster and faster toward the middle of the endless
    trek.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Hurry! Hurry!</q> he called. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Go
    faster! Do you hear me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    But the pendulum merely slowed down again as it struggled back up to its
    second maximum, fated only to fall backward into the depths once more.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Faster! Do you think my life can wait for you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The only response was another clack as the mechanism of the clock advanced
    one increment.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Answer me!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Clack clack clack.</em> And again: <em>Clack clack clack.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Stop!</q> he screamed. But had the scream been heard?
    Had the mathematician flinched?
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn had heard nothing at all. He was aware only of the Commander's
    turning toward him with hands pressed tightly against his ears and with his
    agonized face drawn into deep convolutions that hid old scars in
    shadow. For a moment, then, he saw Pike's eyes grow clear and lucid.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, Effrulyn,</q> Pike said so softly that the young
    man strained to hear, <q ab:speaker="Pike" class="no-close-quote">nothing
    better to do…Tell me, Mathematician, you to whom people are, at most,
    annoying inconveniences…you whose life is spent scribbled on pieces of
    paper, whose life will be summed up in a handful of pages incomprehensible
    to the rest of mankind…tell me, you whose life is washed clean of details,
    whose existence shall be of no interest to anyone, but whose thoughts will,
    in the end, be responsible for everything the rest of us take for
    granted…tell me, what of the rest of us?  The politicians, the great
    conquerors, the daring entrepreneurs and marauders whose epitaphs we assume
    will be written across the galaxy by our own hands? Tell me, Mathematician,
    is it truly because we have nothing better to do, because we can do no
    better?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">No! Don't answer!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The young man remained sitting quietly. He had not heard this cry.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Clack clack clack.</em> But the clock had heard and offered its
    unhesitating reply.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn saw the eyes lose their color then and the older man, older now by
    belbannks, lift himself to his feet, staggering under the weight of his new
    age the constant <em>clack clack clack</em> of the pendulum clock.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn never forgot the look Pike offered him in the next moment with
    those now fogged, unseeing eyes. It was a moment stripped to the bone; the
    figure standing in front of him was a bare skeleton picked raw. The young
    man had never seen anything so helpless or terrified. The terror was not
    directed at any outer menace but at some inner, hidden demon that he,
    Effrulyn, was not permitted to see. During that moment the Commander opened
    his mouth to speak. But the words were never articulated; their silence
    struck the stone floor with his retreating footfalls, leaving only the
    <em>clack clack clack</em> of the great clock to keep Effrulyn in company.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Taljen could always expect to see Alhane doing something when she visited,
    as she often did, but this time she did not like what met her eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Ah!</q> Alhane cried as he swept his apparatus off
    the table. It crashed to the floor, pieces of broken glass caught up in the
    tangle of wires.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen stepped fully into the room. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Alhane! What's
    wrong?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane sighed and looked skyward. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Who knows what's
    wrong?</q> Then he bent to pick up the coil of wire that he had knocked
    away. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Look at this,</q> he said gruffly as he
    reconnected it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen walked up to the workbench and passed her fingers over the coil,
    glowing dull red. It was warm—warmer than the hot, surrounding air. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">And how did you do this, my favorite Time Keeper?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I just connected one of my windmill dynamos to this
    wire. But, you see, the heat is feeble and will not be of any real
    value.</q> Alhane switched off the current and wiped the profuse sweat from
    his brow. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">We had better concentrate on
    insulation. Use graskwool, of course. I've also found that the burned-out
    charcoal is an excellent insulator. We should grind it up and line the
    outer walls with it. But as for providing a new fuel, I am at a loss. It
    will be a cold Short Patra, this one coming. And I am afraid it will be our
    last.</q> The silver-haired man sat down at the bench and put his head in
    his hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Time Keeper,</q> Taljen said, coming up behind him
    and massaging his neck, <q ab:speaker="Taljen">you need a rest.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It's only this hot wind. It stifles my
    imagination.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">It isn't the wind, truly. You've been working not
    only on the fuel problem but on the astronomy as well—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">That! It ties my mind up in knots. First I try this
    and that, then I pretend I am standing on the Runaway and looking at
    Patra-Bannk, then the other way around, then from the sun as well—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Why don't you take a rest?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And the orbits aren't circles. Not the Runaway's, at
    least. Patra-Bannk's, maybe. Not the Runaway's. I am wracking my brain. The
    observations make no sense. And what Stringer said about the stars moving
    constantly…naturally I assumed the same for the planets. But is that the
    case? Nothing is coming out right.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Alhane, you must take a break from this work.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It may as well be Mid-Patra, for all I am able to
    see. My soul is in the dark. It is a long night, I can feel that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Time Keeper!</q> Taljen shouted, shaking Alhane by
    the shoulders. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I have never seen anyone so depressed
    in my life. Is that like a Tjenen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I don't know, is it? Am I depressed?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You most certainly are. I've never seen anything
    like it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I'm lost; the work is at a dead end. There is no
    place to go.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You have to take a rest,</q> Taljen repeated, more
    softly this time. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">The Bannk is waning and the
    teclads are rapidly shortening. Some have begun dancing below, where it is
    cooler. You can join them. It might clear your mind, don't you think?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You know I don't dance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I don't see why you shouldn't. You're more clever
    than the rest of us put together. I think you should be able to figure out
    how to dance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">That's not it, Taljen. You
    know dancing doesn't interest me. It takes too much time away from what
    needs to be done—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">But you aren't getting anything done.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You like to dance; I like to work. Or, at least, I
    need to work.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen sighed and her shoulders drooped. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I am
    beginning to see this Bannk, Time Keeper, that your life isn't as I had
    always viewed it. I used to see you as always happy and having fun with
    what you did. But now I wonder, Alhane, where is the fun in your life?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Ah, my Carefree Taljen, you are the best dancer in
    all of Ta-tjenen, I'd not be surprised. Sometimes I envy you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You envy me, Alhane?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">In my work, I am riding a grask that I cannot
    stop. The work sweeps me along. I love it as much of the time as I can, but
    there is so little choice in the matter. You, I envy you your choice. You
    could go south with Stringer. I never could; my work forbids it. I look
    around at the rest of Ta-tjenen and sometimes wonder how I was so unlucky
    to get stuck with being Time Keeper. If I had my life to live over, I would
    do something useful, perhaps become a grask tender.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">But, Alhane, who else could be Time Keeper? You have
    so much more intelligence than the rest of us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane laughed his squeaky laugh. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">We aren't talking
    about intelligence, though I'll certainly not deny there is such a thing,
    and present in some more than in others. I may not have any more natural
    intelligence than you or any number of Tjenens, that I don't know.</q> He
    cocked his head for a moment. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I think, in my own
    defense, I might—no pun intended—have a different time sense than you. To
    an average Tjenen, the Bannks are short and fly quickly. So it is with me
    also. But when I am hard at work, the time seems to expand and the clads
    double or triple in length, allowing me to get more done. I will work on
    pages of observations and look up and the clock will have hardly moved a
    notch. There is that.…And there were my parents. You never met them, did
    you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">No, that was before I was old enough to
    remember.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Oh, how I hated them both. They were always telling
    me what an idiot I was and at the same time pushing me to do this and
    that. In one breath I was brilliant and in the next I was worthless. I ask
    you, where is the reason in that? Well, I've long since given up wasting my
    time hating them for it, but I've always wished I were a member of a
    nestrexa instead.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You've never told me that before, Alhane. I always
    got along very well with all of my parents, maybe because they would only
    have to put up with me for a Parlztlu.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I wish I could claim that, but, alas, I can't. I
    wouldn't go through a family again even for gravity.…And there's always the
    libido, for lack of a better word. Nervous energy. It can't all be
    dissipated on my wife. And now that she's gone, I'm even more restless and
    need to occupy myself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">You could get another for the next Parlztlu.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane smiled and frowned at the same time. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I am
    afraid that a Time Keeper can never enter into the Parlztluzan. Not that I
    would know who to pick at this point. You're too young, my Taljen. Besides,
    I ask you, would you want to go through it? I drove my wife crazy with my
    habits. Do you think it is worth it to be the wife of a Time Keeper?
    Although I can't say, never having been a husband to a Time Keeper, I would
    doubt it. But I might tell you, since you brought up the matter, that you
    should consider getting someone else. You will have to next Bannk,
    anyway.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen turned away. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Oh, Alhane…you're the only one
    who talks to me any more. I might as well be an Alien myself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Are you sure no one will talk to you? Many have
    asked me about you. They come to me all the time and wonder what you are
    doing. They say, <q>We've just come from Taljen's house and she says she
    isn't feeling well,</q> or they say, <q>Taljen says her shift is just
    beginning and she doesn't have time.</q> Admittedly, people don't talk much
    in the Bannk; there is too much to be done for the Patra. But is it they
    who aren't talking? I wonder, Taljen, if I am the only one who is
    depressed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen sat down cross-legged on the cluttered floor; her hair prevented
    Alhane from seeing her lowered face. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I don't
    know. Everything is so different now that I'm back, so mixed up. How can I
    talk to them? I have nothing to say. How can I pick a nesta after having
    spent so long with one person only—an Alien, for that matter? No one trusts
    me after having been with him. It isn't the same now. I don't know how else
    to put it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You have never spoken to me about what happened on
    the journey.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">If I could tell you what happened on that journey,
    then I would know myself. But I don't.</q> Her words ended with an abrupt
    change in intonation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You are bitter. Was Stringer so terrible to you?
    Have I misjudged him so completely?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen suddenly jumped to her feet and ran from the room. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">He lied to me all the time. I hate him!</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Thirty-Three</div>Education</h2>

  <p>
    It wasn't easy. Despite the fact that Stringer often worked under hypnosis
    to further slow his already slowed time sense, despite the fact that he
    often fasted for beclads to increase his perception, it still wasn't
    easy. The training took weeks or months or teclads, none of which meant
    much now. Neberdjer, the central control, rotated into night, but Stringer
    and Valyavar and Barbalan hardly noticed. An entire city lay before
    Stringer waiting to be explored, but he rarely moved from his desk at the
    information center while he learned everything he could about the planet he
    was to save.
  </p>

  <p>
    He often despaired, often swore to Neberdjer that he would give up. And in
    these moments, when learning anything seemed hopeless, he would envisage
    the Time Keeper at his own desk, silver hair draped over a mass of
    difficult calculations, refusing always to concede defeat until the
    resistive problem crumbled beneath his onslaught. Then Stringer would sigh,
    marveling at the older man's infinite energy, and return to work, still
    never believing that he and his companions could ever save a planet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer saw his friends rarely, but he looked forward to the time he could
    spend with them. On one of these occasions he entered his sleeping
    quarters, an almost bare room with a couch taken from the information
    center to serve as a bed, and saw Barbalan sitting there stiffly and
    breathing heavily. Her skin was shades lighter and infinitely softer now
    than in the Bannk, almost the only sign that beyond the city was total
    darkness.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What's the matter?</q> Stringer asked as he
    approached her.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan just shook her head absently and blinked her eyes. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">Stringer, I don't think I can go on with this.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer, puzzled, stretched out on the couch and pulled her head down on
    his chest. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">With what?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">With all of this. I think I am going crazy—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That doesn't sound like the confident Barbalan I
    have always known.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan sighed deeply. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">A great failing in my life
    is that people always mistake my actions for confidence.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">An easy mistake with you, don't you think?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan shook her head. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I do what I feel should
    be done. Mostly I am not confident of the outcome at all, but what does
    that have to do with it? I do not act because I am confident but because I
    am not afraid to fail. I think about the problem until it is clear that
    further thinking will only confuse. Then I stop thinking and do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">A great talent, I think, to know
    when to stop thinking, and an even greater one to not be afraid to
    fail.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">It is very simple. But this is not
    simple. Neberdjer shows me and Valyavar how to get from here to there. He
    says, <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">These controls won't fit your hands, so use
    these if you want to do this.</q> I am shown how to operate other devices
    and still more. But, Stringer, I don't even know what any of them do. I
    don't know what Neberdjer is. The devices it shows us might as well be
    magic and it a god. It isn't, is it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer didn't laugh. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Barbalan, I think I
    understand what you are going through. I'm amazed that you've been able to
    withstand it. Look, at Konndjlan you have clockmakers and scientists,
    right?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you understand what they do?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Some. Not all of it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, I think that what surrounds us is only a
    great extension of the work they are doing. I don't understand it all
    myself, but that doesn't stop me from using it. The point is to accept it
    without having to understand it all. Have faith that there is some logic
    behind it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">But when Neberdjer says, <q
    ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Here is a display of the neutrino flux on the inside
    of the collection sphere to monitor the decay rate of the black hole,</q> I
    hear words that have no meaning. I don't even know what a neutrino is. Is
    Neberdjer playing games with me? Could you read a book all the way through
    that was in a foreign language? I feel as if I am trying to live in a world
    that is in a foreign language. Why do I have to be so important all of a
    sudden? It was much easier before.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer held her head gently in his hands. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Barbalan, listen to me. The only difference between
    you and me is that I was brought up in a world where I could believe that
    two plus two equals four. I don't understand why two plus two equals four
    any better than you do. I'm just used to the words and concepts floating
    around all the time. When somebody hands me a graser and says that it
    shoots coherent gamma rays, I don't balk because I've heard the words
    before. But I'm just now learning what a coherent gamma ray really is. You
    can do it. I'll help you all I can.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan smiled faintly and nodded.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But now…for some basics.</q> Stringer began
    unfastening her shirt.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Sometime later, deep in the Patra, Stringer was disturbed by a huge hand on
    his shoulder. Since there were only two other pairs of hands in all of
    Neberdjer, it did not take much of a guess to know this was Valyavar.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I think we have something that you'd like to
    see. To go?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, and I think I have something you'd like to
    know.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I'd not wager that yours is as good as this. Let's
    go.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar took Stringer beneath the city and pulled him into a room. At the
    first step Stringer recoiled and dove for the exit; there was no floor in
    the room and three walls were absent also.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Come on, Stringer,</q> Barbalan called from the
    other side. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">The floor's there, really.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Gingerly, Stringer stepped across and found that there was indeed something
    to walk on.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Now watch.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan put her hand on a hidden control and the light went out.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Other than not being able to see anything, what am
    I supposed to see?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Watch.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly the sky around him lit up. To his right and to his left were
    lines, luminous, streaking across the blackness. Farther out were stars;
    some seemed near, others far and isolated. Still others were arranged in
    rosettes and pentagons. There were hundreds, thousands, or tens of
    thousands, creating an artificial heaven beneath their feet.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">The inside of Patra-Bannk,</q> said Valyavar.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Those lines must be some of the tunnels. I wonder
    why they're lit up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">With such a spectacle as this, do you ask for a
    better reason, my friend?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The three of them stood quietly for a long time, simply watching and
    enjoying the silent peace. Eventually Stringer said, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Now I have something to tell you. I think I finally
    understand what a stability correction mechanism is.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">That means you can fix it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, that's your department. I just think I
    understand the problem. And yes, it is quite a problem—one big enough to
    destroy this entire planet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I've wondered about it, too. Has something to do
    with that black hole? They're supposed to be powerful things, those holes,
    and Neberdjer mentioned tides.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head, but Valyavar didn't see this in the dark.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">What did you say?</q> Valyavar asked, not seeing.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm sorry, the answer to your question is no. That
    object there—do you see that one right below us, that bright orange one,
    the size of Two-Bit's moon? I'll bet that's it, or rather the energy
    collection sphere around it. Do you believe that the object that is holding
    us to the surface of this planet is hardly bigger than the size of this
    room? More than twenty-five hundred Two-Bit masses crushed into a ball less
    than fifty meters in diameter, crushed into a ball so dense that light
    can't escape from it, or virtually anything else, either. You're right,
    it's a powerful thing when you get close enough to it. Nearby, as it pulled
    you in, it would rip you apart, collapse you to nothing, and stretch you to
    infinity all at once. But we're far enough away from it here. After all, on
    the planet's surface we feel only a little more than one Two-Bit gravity
    from it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">So what's the problem, then?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm getting to that. It isn't a simple matter,
    exactly. The problem is that this world is round.…That ball you see lit up,
    floating there, is doing exactly that: floating. And there is no reason for
    it to stay in the center. Patra-Bannk is a spherical shell built around the
    energy collection sphere, built around the small black hole in the center,
    right?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The others nodded, unseen.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That's what causes the whole problem. You see,
    because this planet is a spherical shell, the gravitational force it exerts
    on anything on the inside cancels out. On the inside of a hollow sphere you
    find there isn't any gravity. Anything on the inside will pretty much float
    where it's put. Neutral stability, Neberdjer calls it. Rings are unstable;
    they tend to collide with the central object—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">But back to spheres. If there is no gravity on the
    inside and things will stay pretty much where put, what is the problem?
    Won't the hole stay centered?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer" class="no-close-quote">That <q>pretty much</q> is
    the whole problem. The basic thing to keep in mind is that neutral
    stabilities don't last. Exactly why is a little complicated. Patra-Bannk is
    in orbit around a sun. To a very good approximation, the sphere and the
    hole travel in the same orbit, everything is fine, and the hole stays
    centered. That's because, according to Neberdjer, an orbit is independent
    of the mass of the orbiting body. But suppose the sphere has irregularities
    in it: more mountains on one side; mass concentrations here and there. Then
    the sphere is no longer really a sphere and slight gravitational forces
    appear between parts of the shell and the black hole. A slight additional
    problem is caused by the fact that both the hole and Patra-Bannk are
    rotating, thus bending slightly, and, again, are no longer spheres. Both
    effects cause the black hole to drift relative to the shell.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer" class="no-close-quote">But the most important
    problems are those caused by the tidal forces between Patra-Bannk and the
    sun. Because Patra-Bannk is so huge and one side so much closer to the sun
    than the other, that side gets attracted to the sun slightly more than the
    far side. So Patra-Bannk is bent by <q>tidal forces,</q> the same forces
    that raise ocean tides. The bending is, to a good approximation,
    symmetrical, but not quite. Thus, the planet's center of mass shifts ever
    so slightly. Then the shell and the hole begin to follow slightly different
    orbits and the neutral stability is upset.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer" class="no-close-quote">And we're still not
    through. There are even more tidal force problems. The black hole raised
    tidal bulges on the sun which, in turn, exert a force back on the shell and
    the hole. These forces tend to circularize the orbits, and synchronize the
    rotation period of the planet with its period of revolution around the
    sun. This might be why Patra-Bannk is spinning so slowly: Since the control
    mechanism broke, it has been slowing down. Anyway, because the
    circularization rates for the hole and the shell are slightly different,
    the center of mass again is slightly shifted and again the hole drifts a
    little. And there is even the possibility that Patra-Bannk could begin to
    start resonating and fly apart because of these forces, so you have to be
    careful about that too.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The point is, that Patra-Bannk is a very
    complicated system. You need some sort of mechanism—a stability-control
    mechanism or a centering mechanism—to correct for all these problems and
    keep the black hole in the center of the planet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">How is it done?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The two shells are moved slightly to keep the
    black hole centered.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar whistled. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Must take a lot of push to move
    this monster. Not to mention all the energy needed to keep twenty-five
    hundred planets' worth of planet operating. Where does it come from?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Not as much as you'd think for corrections, but
    look. I always wondered why I saw ocean tides on this planet when I didn't
    see any moon. I was just looking in the wrong place.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Coming into view, lit up just for show, was a moon. It moved noticeably
    quickly, traveling toward them, emerging from the light-streaked darkness
    of the giant inverted ball beneath their feet.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Fuel enough to run a civilization for a good many
    years. A convenient storage place, you must admit. Crumble it up into
    little bits, throw it into the hole, and it heats up so much that it
    radiates a fair portion of its mass as energy. Throw in your garbage—throw
    in anything, for that matter—and before it disappears you've put it to its
    best advantage. You don't need oil, coal, uranium, or anything else. Only
    the black hole and garbage.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar was impressed. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Where did they get the
    black hole?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Neberdjer doesn't know because
    it was here when Neberdjer was born. But it has several likely
    mechanisms.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Such as?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, black holes are usually formed by
    supermassive stars collapsing and crushing themselves out of existence by
    the force of their own weight. This one is much too small for that, a
    thousand times too small.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I'd think, then, it would have to be
    manufactured.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Stringer" class="no-close-quote">It
    might have been, but that seems pretty pointless, at least in the present
    state. More energy would be needed to manufacture this one than you could
    ever get from it. But in some sense you're right. You could first make a
    very small one, maybe a fraction of a centimeter in diameter. That one,
    too, would require more energy to make than could be gotten from it. But
    you could use that tiny one as a seed and let it gobble up surrounding
    matter until it got to its present state. You could breed your holes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The other mechanism would be to find one left over
    from the big bang, the beginning of the Universe. There might have been a
    lot created then, of all sizes. All you have to do is find one.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar was impressed again. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Still, it seems to
    me a lot of trouble to go to for a derelict planet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Unless…</q> The conclusion was obvious.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan turned off the sky and switched back on the lights. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">So, we must fix this…centering mechanism. How long do
    we have?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">A good question. Maybe it is time to find out.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How long do we have, Neberdjer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">That is unclear. The problem is both intermittent
    and spreading. I have been overcompensating for the sensors. You see, the
    sensors send me information that tells me exactly where the black hole is,
    and I send out correction signals to adjust the position of the
    planet. Some of the sensors stop sending me signals, so I must interpolate
    from data received by nearby sensors. However, the problem is spreading
    erratically. Many of the sensors are now out and the black hole has drifted
    dangerously far, thousands of kilometers, setting up unbalanced stresses
    and strains on the shell, which I am trying to adjust for.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded; he understood earthquakes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">If this continues to happen, the planet will
    ultimately be destroyed. Although my auxiliary units have checked every
    possible source of the problem, millions of times, the difficulty has
    escaped me. So you must succeed. Do you understand that? You must
    succeed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The three gulped collectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I am printing out a list of the faulty correction
    centers. For a start, you will visit them and see if you can locate the
    problem. Valyavar and Barbalan have been trained to operate what is
    necessary.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer took the list that appeared from a slot near his desk. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Where are these places?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">All over the planet—and elsewhere. The first is
    on the energy collection sphere.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We can't go down there!</q> Stringer shouted.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Not exactly, but there are other ways.</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Thirty-Four</div>The Logic of
  Scientific Discovery</h2>

  <p>
    The desk was cluttered, which was not unusual because the desk belonged to
    Alhane. The old books were opened before him with columns of figures
    scrawled in a fine, neat script. Alhane constantly wondered how his
    predecessor could have wasted time being so neat. After all, life was too
    short to bother with such refinements. But, he conceded, the old Time
    Keeper's neatness did make things easier.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane shivered, pulled his blanket up over his shoulders, puffed life into
    his frozen fingers, tried passing them over his heating coil, then finally
    scribbled down some more figures. Oh, how he hated simple
    arithmetic. Geometry was better. Why couldn't they be separated? Why
    couldn't he be better at both? One thing for sure, a mathematician he
    wasn't. A short snort of amazement—or of disgruntlement—escaped him after
    he finished the computation, and he heard a tapping at his open door.
  </p>

  <p>
    Naturally, it was Taljen. Except for his children, she was the only one
    whom he ever bothered with these days. She needed the bother. Her old self
    had disappeared somewhere on that trip south, and now only the strained
    smile she wore on her face recalled her earlier incarnation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">So, Alhane, Tireless One, you have been pouring over
    those numbers for teclads now, more than a Patra-Bannk. And what have you
    found?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Other than a headache, you ask? Well, it seems as if
    my father made good measurements. So far all of mine agree with his, and
    the clocks can be set by the stars. What an amazing idea! I thank him. Of
    course, I will continue checking.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen sat down on the one bed in Ta-tjenen. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">But
    what have you found?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Well,</q> Alhane sighed, pulling up his blanket
    again. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you want a blanket?</q> He gave his
    graskhide to Taljen, who accepted it gratefully. Alhane thought that if he
    had a pan of water in the room, it would freeze over this Patra. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">At first, after you convinced me to put the sun in the
    center, I thought for sure that nature would have made the orbits
    circles. If you were nature, wouldn't you do that? Squares don't seem very
    probable. After all, why, I ask you, should a planet first go in one
    direction and then suddenly change to another? Any force emanating from the
    sun certainly wouldn't act in such an erratic manner. But a circle, now
    <em>there</em> is an aesthetically pleasing shape. Unfortunately, all my
    work over the last Patra-Bannk indicates that the orbits, at least the
    orbit of the Runaway, isn't quite a circle. Almost, but not quite.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What do you think it is?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane snorted again, then sneezed. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I am
    certain—they must be ellipses. After circles, ellipses are unquestionably
    the most pleasing of all shapes. Nature would have been foolish to pass up
    such an opportunity—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">But?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Humph. I have finally derived an equation here for
    an orbit. And if it is an ellipse, I can't see it. Therefore I have made a
    mistake and will have to start looking again. I renounce this equation!</q>
    Alhane lifted his arm and was about to throw the paper away, but Taljen
    caught his hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">How do you know that your equation is not correct
    and the orbits are, in fact, not ellipses?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I trust my nose and not foolish equations.</q>
    Alhane sneezed. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Well, are you ready to help me set
    the clocks?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen stood up. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">That's why I'm here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Good. It has been too long since I made the last
    trip Above. Now, let me see…</q> Alhane took out his father's star charts
    and found the star he had currently been using to set his clocks. He made a
    mental note of its position so that when he went outside, he would be sure
    to find it.
  </p>

  <p>
    As he was bent over the paper, Taljen asked, <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Why are
    you so worried about keeping your clocks set, Alhane? We always come out on
    the right beclad, even with the old way, even if you never set your clocks
    all Patra.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Sometimes we do. You might not know the difference
    between one beclad and another, but I do. So don't tell anyone, all right?
    Now, help me get into this quazzat. The Patra is deep and my old body will
    need help in confronting it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    A little while later, Alhane was wrapped in the layers of graskhide, wool,
    and parkas that made up a quazzat. He checked the chemical heaters in the
    boots, ensuring that there was plenty of air for insulation and that his
    hood was totally unfurled.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Will you be all right?</q> Taljen asked anxiously.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Of course,</q> came Alhane's muffled voice, <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">As long as I keep moving and breathe through my
    nose. Now, help me up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen opened the inner door to the air lock Alhane had built directly
    under his house. Handing him a lantern, she shut the door after him, and
    Alhane pushed open the hatch that led into one of his workrooms. The house
    was empty. Pieces of roof, having fallen during the winds, littered the
    floor. The door was blown in and large holes gaped in the ceiling. Alhane
    had seen this often enough; it did not bother him. Repair would begin as
    usual at Bannk's beginning.
  </p>

  <p>
    The little yard was quiet. A glaze of ice covered everything, too cold to
    be slippery, reflecting the starlight in half-seen images. The air was not
    quite as still as it was cold, but the wind was mild in midpatra, seemingly
    frozen out of the sky. Only the long hood on his quazzat heated the air
    enough for Alhane to breathe, or else his lungs would freeze, too. He
    cleared his mouth and the spit tinkled against the snow, frozen solid
    before it hit the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane spent a moment, as always, gazing upward and smiling. Then he bent
    to his instruments. He had two tasks now: first to set his clocks, then to
    take a new reading on the position of the Runaway. He found the star he had
    been following, easily identifiable as the brightest in a rosette of five
    others. He bent to his quadrant and sighted along the notched eyepiece,
    then brought his lantern close to the metal scale and took the reading. He
    ran over to the house and shouted down his speaking tube to Taljen. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you have that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes, I'll check the charts for the time.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane turned next to the Runaway, another planet, he was sure from what
    Stringer had told him. He sighted it and took an accurate measurement of
    its position. Amazed at his own stubbornness, he still did not fully trust
    his father's readings, even though they all agreed with his own. But
    perhaps a new reading would show him where his equation was wrong. New data
    never hurt.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finished, Alhane stood up and took one more look around before he prepared
    to go Under once more. Something caught his eye on the plain to the west of
    Ta-tjenen, on one of the planting fields. It was a light! A large circle of
    yellow light, with smaller bright spots inside, illuminated a big part of
    the field. What could that be? Light in midpatra? By Lashgar—or was it
    Sarek?—that made no sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I'll be down shortly,</q> he called to Taljen.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Where are you going?</q> Taljen called up after him,
    but she received no answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane held his lantern in front of him as he set off for the light. His
    destination was marked but the path to it unlit, and he fell time and again
    on the rock-hard snow and ice.
  </p>

  <p>
    A scant kilometer later, he reached the periphery of the light and was
    surprised to see a large building being erected. Three walls built of
    precious tree trunks and other materials had already been constructed. Men
    scurried back and forth and gathered around bonfires. Searchlights shone
    into the dark and lanterns were strung, burning not with flame and swaying
    in the wind. What could they be doing out here when it was suicide to
    remain Above for more than a telclad or two? Alhane wondered. In the midst
    of all the activity sat three ships, just like the one Stringer had
    flown. Stringer! Could he have returned? Alhane started running toward the
    construction site. Stringer back? How amazing!
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane was now close to the circle of light. He could easily hear the
    cutting of trees and the moving about and the hammering of wood. Men
    continually came and went into the three spacecraft, replacing others for
    the new shift. A small figure standing in the darkness outside the area of
    illumination, Alhane was not noticed. Should he try to find Stringer? The
    idea of seeing him again was exceedingly pleasant. He never though it would
    happen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, he said to himself, if I am going to risk freezing myself to death, I
    should not do it for nothing. No, by Lashgar, if by no one else. Alhane
    walked forward into the camp. No one stopped him; under his bulky wraps he
    looked no different from anyone else. He drew close to one of the fires,
    hopefully to warm his feet since the heaters had ceased.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two men paused briefly at the fire next to Alhane. He heard them talking
    with an accent so strange that it was not even his own language. He
    listened for a few moments to this odd dialect and finally began picking
    out familiar words and then putting together whole phrases.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum worker 1">Do you think the plan will work?</q> he
    heard one say after he had taken a moment to reconstruct the sentence.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum worker 2">It is a good plan. Our Commander has never
    failed, has he?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum worker 1">Careless men have died out here, even
    careful ones.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum worker 2">Is that the Commander's fault?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum worker 1">Yes, you're right about that. This Bannk,
    Triesk will fall for certain and the Polkraitz will be Returned.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane jumped and moved quickly away from the fire. He circled outward
    again, this time passing close to one of the shuttles. On the wing was a
    black patch crossed with orange. Gostum! An invasion! A surprise attack!
  </p>

  <p>
    The cold, which was now beginning to creep through Alhane's boots, could
    not have made him move any faster toward the city than he would have on his
    own.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he climbed through the airlock, Taljen was still waiting for him. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Alhane, your spirit and your reason have parted
    company! I thought I'd never see you again.</q> Her voice was modulating
    quickly and the tempo was fast. For a moment she paused and slowed down. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Did you get the reading for your planet?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes, no, I forget. Verlaxchi's out for us now. I'm
    almost ready to believe there's something to this Golun-Patra.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">But your reading—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It's not important now. I'd thank you to take it
    again for me. I must see the nestrexam.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Alhane! Have you walked away from your mind? What
    happened out there?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane was not listening but was hurriedly removing his quazzat, blindly
    stumbling toward the door with the outer parka stuck over his head. Taljen
    grabbed him as he collided with the door frame and pulled it off. She
    steadied him by the shoulders. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Alhane, Old Teacher,
    please tell me what has minced your head.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">My young student, who never believed anything I
    said, you certainly won't believe this: there is a Gostum camp not more
    than a kilometer from here and they are preparing to invade
    Ta-tjenen. There are also three shuttles out there like Stringer's.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer!</q> Taljen cried. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Is he there?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I don't know; I didn't see him.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen's eyes grew misty and lost what little sparkle remained in them. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">And I thought that I was finally free of him, that I
    was on my way to forgetting him.…He must be there. The last time I saw him
    he was on his way south with a Gostum woman to find his friend. She knew
    where this friend was. Stringer must be Returned.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do not jump to conclusions, Taljen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Am I?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Time Keeper turned toward the door. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I must see
    the nestrexam,</q> he said without looking back.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The nestrexam was in session. Alhane paced furiously, waiting for the
    couple who had failed to conceive before one of them went off. An important
    matter, indeed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally they finished and Alhane was called. He walked in, his breath
    visible in the cold air.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">What is it, Alhane?</q> asked Kenken Wer. <q
    ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">You're acting like a crazed Verlaxchi.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You'll be acting like that in a moment, you old
    fools.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Alhane, we don't need this. Speak what you want
    to speak.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Ta-tjenen is going to be invaded by the Gostum. I
    saw them building a camp a kilometer west of here, with Alien shuttles, and
    heard them speaking of the invasion.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">In the middle of the Patra? You are the only one
    foolish enough to venture out there.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane had expected this reaction. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">And now the
    Gostum have also become foolish.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">But how can we believe you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Look for yourselves! Don't you ever do that? If I am
    wrong, then I am the only fool and no harm is done. If I am right and no
    precautions are taken, then all of Ta-tjenen will be destroyed. I'll be in
    my workroom.</q> Alhane spun around and left.
  </p>

  <p>
    He found Taljen waited silently in his workroom among the ticking of his
    clocks.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Did they believe you?</q> Taljen asked, looking up,
    her voice constricted by choking sobs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No, but they will very shortly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen lapsed into silence.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You are thinking of Stringer. Not very Tjenen of
    you.</q> Alhane walked to one of his desks and rummaged about under some
    papers. He pulled a worn book from the mess and held it out to Taljen. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Do you remember this, Taljen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen nodded. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Yes, it's Stringer's journal.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane tossed it gently to her. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You might read
    it. Maybe it will tell you something you didn't know before and your hate
    for Stringer will subside. Maybe not. But, I ask you, read it before you
    pass judgment on Stringer as a traitor.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    A messenger called Alhane to the council room at that moment. Already word
    must have begun to travel, because the room was densely packed with
    people. At least that made it warmer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer stroked her chin. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">You are right,
    Alhane. There are Gostum to the west with Alien solofars. Surely this is
    another result of the Golun-Patra and the Alien Stringer. He should have
    been executed, clearly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What makes you so sure it is Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">The evidence: he came on the Golun, was found
    with a dead Gostum, he killed, he caused the fire; he is the Polkraitz
    Returned. The Alien solofars lie at our Gateway; what other evidence do you
    need?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane felt his surety slipping but also found himself shouting. His voice
    squeaked. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You have no direct evidence and you are a
    bunch of superstitious old fools! Why do you not confront the problem that
    is at hand instead of falling back on your useless superstitions? Polkraitz
    or not, argued from now until the crawfish whistles on the hill, does
    nothing to alter the problem.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">What do you suggest?</q> Kenken Wer sighed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Asking my advice?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Yes, we are asking your advice.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane couldn't remember the last time his advice had been sought by anyone
    but Stringer. It was an interesting sensation. He liked it. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">I thank you. We are in a very bad position. You feel
    the cold creeping in on us. The Tree Counters could tell you what is in
    store for us next Bannk and any Patra afterward—if there are to be any. Now
    we have the Gostum to face, surely. If we fight, we lose time collecting
    fuel. Even if we win, the time is still lost, that I can tell you without
    being Time Keeper. Death is a certainty if we fight. Surrender is the only
    possibility. At least in that even, there is hope.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">No. The result is known. Gostum show no
    mercy. We would all be killed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Would we?</q> Alhane asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="nestrexam member">There can be no argument about that,</q>
    said another of the nestrexam, <q ab:speaker="nestrexam member">but if you
    want, we can hold a referendum.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No, the outcome of that would
    be clear.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    After a poll of the nestrexam had been taken, Kenken Wer announced, <q
    ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">We must prepare for the attack and defeat of the
    Gostum.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span ab:speaker="Alhane">This is collective suicide,</span> Alhane
    thought. <span ab:speaker="Alhane">Realizing that survival beyond next
    Patra was, at best, dubious, they have decided to kill themselves.
    Call it a war, it was still suicide.</span> But Alhane shrugged it off—for
    the time being. When a house is burning, one doesn't waste time deciding
    what to do with it. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">All right. We must begin
    immediately. I have a few ideas.</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Thirty-Five</div>Dialogue
  Concerning a Third World System</h2>

  <p>
    Stringer saw with eyes that registered too much and touched with limbs that
    felt too little. His vision was swamped with infrared on the lower end and
    ultraviolet on the upper. The resulting scene was impossibly confusing,
    supercharged with color. A moment's concentration brought first a mistake:
    gamma rays, blinding, not meant for Stringer's brain to interpret. He
    reeled and dropped to his knees. After a moment of recovery, he had learned
    the trick and his sight was restored to normal.
  </p>

  <p>
    That problem could be dealt with, then, but the remaining one could not:
    lack of weight. He was light on his feet; he could move as freely as
    ever. Where were the signs of the superheavy bodies that he and his
    companions were wearing? Valyavar, next to him, was still a giant, not the
    tall, muscular friend he had known for so long, but a squat metal ovoid
    equipped with superpowered limbs to overcome thousands of
    gravities. Stringer wanted to bear the weight crushing down on him but
    couldn't. Not to be able to do so was physically unexpected and
    unreal. This was probably very lucky for him but was, nonetheless,
    disappointing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan, on Stringer's other side, was indistinguishably sexless. She
    rolled her eyes to the top of her head, the very top, and saw the splendid
    artificial sky that she had witnessed in awe once before. This time,
    though, she watched it from its proper viewing spot: the Center.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike the Upper World with inconceivable numbers of kilometers to spare,
    the energy collection sphere was jammed from centimeter to centimeter. The
    landscape was floodlighted with a sodium-tinged orange glow that covered
    everything. Nearest to them was one of the thousands of dishes that
    pockmarked the surface of the inner planet. No doubt hundreds of thousands
    of kilometers above it was another dish to collect the huge amounts of
    energy that one beamed upward.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer began to walk toward it, happily noticing that the horizon was
    much nearer than it had been Above. After five minutes, when he hadn't
    drawn appreciably closer to his destination, he realized that though he now
    was on a world more like the size of Two-Bit, even to motorized legs it was
    still a big place.
  </p>

  <p>
    He turned back to Valyavar and Barbalan, who were standing at the base of
    one of the giant, featureless structures, ovoid like their bodies, that
    seemed to take up all the space between dishes. When he reached them, the
    three walked inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">This is the sensor site,</q> Valyavar announced,
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">right beneath us. And between the sensors…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Can we see it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Of course,</q> Neberdjer interrupted. <q
    ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I can show you the fate of Patra-Bannk's garbage
    after it has been gasified.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer had expected to see nothing, because, as he knew, a black hole is
    truly black. Instead, as the port opened he saw a blinding flash of light
    and quickly tinted his eyes. Unafraid now, he changed magnification,
    scanned the different portions of the spectrum his brain could stand, and
    mixed frequencies in all proportions. He watched the swirling gas beneath
    him sucked into the hole, heating itself up as if in a sun, and liberating
    glowing colors: orange, red, yellow, x, and ultra, the last gasp of matter
    before it disappeared forever into infinitely curved space time. Yes, the
    mass of the hole would increase a trifle after it radiated away a large
    part of its mass as energy. But what were a few kilograms here and there?
  </p>

  <p>
    By the time he had finished his examination in all the variety his new
    senses would permit, Valyavar and Barbalan were well under way with their
    work.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Nothing wrong here,</q> Valyavar announced
    sometime later. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">The sensors all seem to be
    working, and I can get a display of the signal from each of them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer watched the screen light up, numbers flashing and changing in the
    twinkling of an eye, numbers that represented the force of gravity on this
    point of the collection sphere.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">So, 'tis time to go.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Neberdjer said the problem was intermittent. Let's
    wait.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Wait they did, but everything remained stable. Then they walked back into
    the robots' storeroom and climbed into the storage cells. The next thing
    Stringer knew, he was back in the remote-control room staring at Barbalan,
    who looked much better to him in her natural body. He stepped off his
    platform, around which had been projected a three-dimensional world for him
    to work in. No, it had been more than projected; he had felt, touched,
    seen—in many ways—and heard. In essence, he had been standing on the
    collection sphere himself, more than two hundred and ninety thousand
    kilometers below where his feet were now resting.
  </p>

  <p>
    He took Barbalan's hand as she stepped down from her own dais. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">What did you think of that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan did not think she liked the grin on Stringer's face. She
    shivered. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Stringer, I've told you before how hard
    it is…This last went beyond me completely, and I have lost my grip on what
    is real and what isn't.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer took her in his arms and caressed her for a long time. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">It is difficult. Remember, I don't understand most of
    it, either.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Tseems, Neberdjer,</q> Valyavar said later, <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">that nothing is wrong down there.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Neberdjer displayed a blank screen. <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">But you see
    nothing coming in. A deceptively simple problem.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Is the link bad? Has it collapsed recently?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">No. I have checked them out. Nothing is coming
    through.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Tis not for me to say, mayhaps, but—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Wait a minute,</q> Stringer interrupted. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Why don't we try a few more sites? We didn't spend
    enough time down there, really, but maybe we can get clues elsewhere.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Tis fine to me, but I'll stake a peldram of kob
    that we don't find anything amiss.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They took a car to the terminal. Stringer glanced at his list of faulty
    sensor sites and then up to the map. Their destination was an island on an
    ocean, several hundred thousand kilometers to the southwest. Stringer swung
    around the full circle of the giant map. He shook his head and chuckled
    softly. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you realize that on this scale Two-Bit
    would probably be about this big…</q> He put his finger to the map and
    traced out a little square a few centimeters. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">A
    big planet, yuh?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Yuh,</q> Valyavar replied, <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">but what for?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Population, I would guess.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar stroked his long beard. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I'm not so
    sure.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Take Two-Bit. I have wandered over her face many
    times, and 'tseems to me that, unchecked, her population would outrun even
    this planet in a few hundred years, and a few hundred years after that,
    would outrun a planet a thousand times this big. Populations move fast,
    little Stringer, too fast to be believed. But a few hundred years won't
    give Two-Bit the technology to build a Patra-Bannk, will it? Before you
    build a Patra-Bannk, population problems must be over and done with.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Then why do you need a planet this big?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">A good question, though mayhaps another good one
    is: why so small?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't follow.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">If they could build a planet this big, they could
    have built it a hundred or a thousand times larger. If they simply wanted
    room to grow a larger population than they could have had before, why stop
    with such a small world?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Patra-Bannk small!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Ah, Stringer, look to Two-Bit and her
    sisters. Think! All of them together are too small, as I have seen and as
    you must have. Patra-Bannk is too small. Even the Universe is too small to
    a growing population. You have to stop somewhere. The question is
    where. Why build a big world when it will last only a few hundred years?
    Why build a bigger world when that won't last much longer? Unless you
    decide to stop growing. But where do you decide to stop? 'Tis not at all
    clear to me, Stringer, and mayhaps your question is indeed the better one:
    why do you need such a big planet? Only one thing is clear: Patra-Bannk
    comes <em>after</em> solutions, not before.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Sometimes, Valyavar, you can be too
    reasonable.</q> Stringer now wondered about the Tjenens, the Tjenens who
    had better hearing and better eyesight, who needed less sleep, whose
    adaptable skin, first soft, then dark and leathery, helped to protect them
    from Patra-Bannk. And the Tjenens could easily adjust the growth rate of
    their population by <q>Changing Houses</q> or not.…Would the Tjenens with
    their <q>peculiar</q> biology, rather than the Bitters, be the ones who
    would survive long enough to build the next Patra-Bannk? Stringer didn't
    know. Mayhaps Two-Bit would work things out, overcoming the natural
    propensity of their biology. But whose biology was <q>peculiar</q> that
    needed overcoming? Stringer sighed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Let's go,</q>
    he said aloud as he touched the correct bar and walked into the room
    awaiting them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar grumbled softly, <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Twill be a long
    trip.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head as he felt the slight push he remembered from last
    time. This time, he could offer an explanation. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">As
    it is only one hop, it won't take longer than the last; in fact, it will
    take less time.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Less time? But it's nearly twice as far as we've
    ever come. It seems a funny transport that takes less time to go
    farther.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But we're falling faster to make up for the extra
    distance.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Falling, little Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Another convenience of a hollow planet. Build a
    tunnel through it and use the gravity of the hole to pull you through.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">We don't go near the hole, do we?</q> Valyavar
    asked with some alarm.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Of course not. We stay pretty close to the surface
    even on the longer trips. On the longest you might feel your weight change
    some.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I still don't see why it won't take us longer to
    go farther.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer thought a moment. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Visualize a clock, like
    the one we saw at Konndjlan, with a huge pendulum swinging back and
    forth. To a first approximation, from no matter what height you drop that
    pendulum, it always takes the same amount of time to complete one swing, to
    reach the same height on the opposite side. That's the main reason pendulum
    clocks are such good timepieces: even if the swing changes its size a
    little, maybe due to friction, it still takes pretty much the same amount
    of time for a swing, whether it is a big swing or a little swing. It's just
    a little longer on the big swings. The reason the times are so closely the
    same is because on the bigger swings the pendulum falls faster than on the
    smaller ones and makes up for lost time. Our car is like the bob on the
    pendulum, except we're being pulled back and forth by the gravity of the
    black hole. And, like the pendulum, all our trips take approximately the
    same amount of time.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You still haven't explained why it takes
    <em>less</em> time on the longer trips.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, from what Neberdjer has shown me, if you
    make the arm of the pendulum shorter, it swings faster. When we go on a
    long trip we are closer to the black hole, and so the arm of our pendulum
    is shortened. So we go faster. To be sure, the swing is bigger, and if the
    pendulum stayed the same length as before, the trip <em>would</em> be
    longer. But in our case, the shortening of the arm more than makes up for
    it, and the longer trips actually take less time, appreciably less time if
    you go far enough.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Wait a moment,</q> Valyavar said, raising a
    finger. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">It's not clear to me where we stop.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shrugged happily and chuckled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Just at
    the other end of the tunnel, where the pendulum is at the same height from
    which it started. We begin the trip from a dead stop, speed up to until the
    middle of the tunnel, then slow down again as the gravity of the hole
    begins to pull us back in the opposite direction. Remember, we noticed all
    that happening on our first trip from Pant. Conveniently, we stop just as
    we reach out destination. Of course, you need something to catch hold of
    you as you stop so that you don't begin falling back again—like a
    pendulum. It's really the simplest mode of transportation. We're just
    falling. No fuel is necessary, just a tunnel and gravity.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">It all sounds too convenient for my
    ears. Certainly something must tend to slow you down, like the friction in
    your clocks. You have to wind up clocks.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Not with evacuated tunnels and metallic hydrogen
    rails to keep the cars levitated. Friction is negligible, so Neberdjer
    tells me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar sat back and twisted up his face. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">One
    thing more and you'll have me convinced. I thought that when you're
    falling, you're weightless. At least I am.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">If we were falling directly into the black hole,
    we would be, until your tidal forces started ripping us apart. But if you
    visualize the situation, part of the black hole's gravity is not pulling us
    across the tunnel but is pulling us down, to the floor of the tunnel. That
    part is greatest near the middle of the trip, when we are closest to the
    hole. So if you feel a little heavy, don't worry about it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You seem to have all the answers, don't you? One
    would think you were trying to become a scientist.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Neberdjer is
    spoon-feeding me. Doctor's orders. The more we know, the more likely we can
    figure out what's wrong here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    After about ten telclads, the car had finished speeding up and slowing
    down, and stopped, and they were at their destination. Stringer immediately
    ran for the exit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Our work is below, not outside,</q> Barbalan said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We can at least take a look for a few moments,</q>
    Stringer answered without halting. He was thinking ahead. He wrapped on the
    suit Neberdjer had provided that would insulate him against any Patra. Out
    he went and into—daylight. Stringer couldn't have been more surprised if
    someone had hit him over the head. The sun was sneaking its way up on the
    western sky for whatever Bannk was due in the southern hemisphere, and the
    air was already warm. The rays of light glanced off what could only be a
    barren plain of metal or glass stretching to infinity in all
    directions. Could this be the bare surface of the planet, worn away or
    never finished? Stringer shook his head and walked back inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We've come a long way,</q> he said. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">We've come out of the Patra and into the Bannk. Look
    for yourselves.</q> Both Barbalan and Valyavar  took the suggestion and
    returned shortly. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you realize,</q> Stringer
    went on, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">that if you unrolled Two-Bit and stretched
    out the equator and walked the length of it, you'd have gone only a tenth
    of the distance we've just traveled, in half the time it takes to cross a
    Two-Bit ocean?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">A big planet still, with a transportation system
    to match it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They went below. On the wide concourse under the terminal stood a
    cylindrical room. Inside, they could look down and see the circular
    arrangements of massive metal cylinders representing one of the thousands
    of sensors scattered all over the planet. Soon Valyavar was at the
    controls, and soon again he looked up. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I'll take
    my kob,</q> he said to Stringer. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Neberdjer, are
    you getting any correction signals from this end?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">No, that is the whole problem.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You did say it was an intermittent failure. I
    thought you might be getting something now.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Well, I'm not.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Tseems to me all the numbers are here, much as I
    suspected.</q> Valyavar went over all the circuits at least three times to
    make sure the signals were going out. Barbalan helped him as much as she
    could. Stringer sat on the floor twiddling his fingers. He began to wonder
    what all this training was about. This did him no good now, so he took up
    his rodoft and began to play.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">What is that?</q> Neberdjer asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Music,</q> Stringer replied. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Listen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Interesting,</q> Neberdjer said, and fell silent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually Barbalan walked over and sat alongside Stringer. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">Nothing,</q> she said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Neberdjer,</q> Valyavar said simultaneously, <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">there isn't anything wrong here.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">What do you mean, nothing wrong? The only reason
    I should not get a signal is if the sensors are nulled. But never is null a
    continuous phenomenon.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Why not? If everything is working—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Because nulled sensors indicate a perfect
    centering, which cannot happen for a finite time when the planet is
    moving. Continual correction of the spheres is required.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Well, Neberdjer, something is surely funny.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Hold on,</q> Stringer said. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I want to know something. You seem to have robots at
    your disposal. Instead of sending us on this wild-goose chase, why don't
    you have them repair the mechanism?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">All the robots of which I am aware are tied
    directly to me. They cannot act independently of me. There is good reason
    in that. What good would come if there was no coordination? Havoc would
    result. That is why I am called Central Control.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What a stupid design!</q> Stringer shouted. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">What if something should go wrong?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Then there is you, the fail-safe mechanism.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't believe you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Believe in what you like.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Did you see that?</q> Valyavar interrupted.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, what?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I thought I saw the screen go blank for a
    second. All's right now.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Are you sure?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Twas quick, mightily so. It may have been me and
    not the screen. Could be that I blinked. But it may have gone out.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That makes things difficult. What should we
    do?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">If there is the possibility, we must check it
    out. Mayhaps we should continue.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Yes, I think you should,</q> Neberdjer said.
  </p>

  <p>
    After waiting for a recurrence of the short-lived event and finding none,
    off they went again. This time the increase in gravity was felt, owing to
    the longer trip and thus the greater proximity of the tunnel to the
    hole. When they arrived at the next terminal, Barbalan squinted her eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Look at the map,</q> she said.
  </p>

  <p>
    All eyes followed her pointing finger. The map was wrong. It was close
    enough to being right, but it was wrong. The colors were off. The room
    light was off, too. Everything was tinted blue. Only after they were
    accustomed to the colors did Stringer realize that the terminal itself was
    not the usual metal, but was stone, blue-gray stone. If they have been
    inside a cave, it might not have been much different. Stringer put his hand
    on the exit. It was warm.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Should we?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">We can get a temperature reading.</q> Valyavar
    disappeared behind the map. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">It's safe,</q> he
    called. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">For Patra-Bannk, anyway.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    They went out. The sky was gray and a red sun showed through. They had now
    traveled so far west that the sun was nearing the eastern horizon. Barbalan
    stood incredulous, never having seen such a thing before. Her time sense,
    like everyone's on Patra-Bannk, had never been good. Now it was completely
    destroyed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The plains surrounding them were jagged, pockmarked with craters as far as
    they could see. Solitary peaks reared up in the distance. Smoke rose from
    the nearest. An artificial volcano, no doubt, recently activated by
    Neberdjer. Certainly that could be done, but for whom? The entire landscape
    was cobalt blue, even the buildings that lay along the path before them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pathway itself was stone. It might have been a hardened lava flow,
    smoothed for walking. Leaning against a strong wind, Stringer followed it
    to the small cluster of stone buildings. As he got closer, he could see
    carvings on their walls that formed an intricate, baroque design. If the
    other cities they had seen looked <q>futuristic</q> the present town was
    their antithesis, something created in a bygone age when a man spent years
    building a column for a cathedral or carving a metope for a temple.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar ran his hand over the stonework, as fresh and as worn as the day
    it was sculpted, however many millions of years ago that was.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you want to go inside?</q> Stringer said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">No, I don't,</q> was all that Valyavar said before
    he turned away.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the correction center, everything seemed in working order. This time
    Barbalan thought she saw the screen blank out for an instant, but she could
    not be sure if that was the reality or if she had been influenced by
    Valyavar's earlier experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was enough to convince them to continue to another site. <q
    ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Yes, I think that is a good idea,</q> Neberdjer
    said, agreeing with the decision. Its response underwent a perceptible
    delay because of the distance the signal was traveling. <q
    ab:speaker="Neberdjer">And I also think it would be a good idea for
    Stringer to play his rodoft again.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">There will be many opportunities for that, I
    suspect,</q> Stringer said.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next city was under an ocean. Stringer watched from an observation
    platform as innumerable forms of marine life, living in the constant
    temperature of the deep ocean, swam out of the gloom and into the
    penetrating lights. The three travelers watched for telclads, until
    Barbalan decided for them that it was time to return to work. The story was
    the same: no problem. This time not even a hint of one.
  </p>

  <p>
    But at Neberdjer's insistence, and because of their own gnawing doubts
    about the two suspected blackouts, they traveled to site after site. As
    Stringer's fingers danced over the rodoft, so the sun danced around the sky
    at each turn, skipping from east to west and from north to south. Time made
    no sense any more, no sense at all. Now the next stop was at the south
    pole. Several hops were required to reach it from the last site they had
    visited. The sky was in almost perpetual twilight as the sun circled low
    over the horizon for Bannks on end, refusing to set. But when it did
    finally set, the sun would remain absent, not rising again for more Bannks
    and Patras, leaving this pole's world in unending cold and darkness.
  </p>

  <p>
    The buildings were built glasslike, the everlasting snow heaped upon their
    exteriors and the frost crystals refracting room lights into all colors of
    the rainbow. The air was cold and, not from the cold, felt strange in their
    lungs, laden with a peculiar element. A single creature, giant and frosty
    gray, slithered across their field of vision. Steam spouted from its center
    as long, plated tentacles pulled it across the snow and ice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar sighed as he looked beyond the creature to the barren tundra. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">You know, my little brother, Hendig's World had one
    city on it. Perhaps, considering the rest are hidden by oceans, clouds, and
    regions like this, it was not strange for Hendig or Polkraitz to find the
    one that may have fulfilled our expectations of it—if, indeed, they found
    the same city at all. But to me, we have been much like the people from the
    little country, where all the towns are close by, who come to the big
    country and wonder where everything is. An easy mistake, perhaps, on this
    world.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Perhaps,</q> Stringer echoed as they walked on.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The sites on the list dwindled to a handful. More cities were seen, other
    sites were in the middle of nowhere, a nowhere that might have been a
    testing range for some colossal experiment, or a game preserve, or just a
    nowhere. The sun continued its dance around the sky. Patra or Bannk, it
    made no difference now. But were it not for the two doubtful events, no
    fault could be found, only disagreement with Central Control.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually one site was left on the list. Before they departed for it,
    Barbalan checked the position on the transportation map and saw that it sat
    on a small <q>island</q> in the middle of the ocean. On the way there,
    Neberdjer's voice interrupted the silence. <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">This
    area has recently been activated. You will need suits and will find them in
    cabinet <em>A</em> in your car. If none can be adjusted to fit, we can
    manufacture extras.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar and Stringer exchanged glances with Barbalan, but they did as they
    were told. The suits adjusted easily to any shape or size. There was no
    problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    Soon the fall to their final city ended as slowly as it had begun. They
    left the terminal suited up and looked down from a low hill. When they came
    outside, Stringer did not know if it was day or night, or if there was such
    a thing here. The air was an emerald-green that glistened of itself. The
    landscape was alien, barren except for salt drifts changing color under the
    glowing sky. The settlement was small, built of black plates stacked in a
    skewed heap and held separate by pillars of the same black
    material. Another <q>town</q> could be seen in the distance and a third yet
    farther on. Each again stacked and skewed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The impression that had been building up in Stringer's mind for teclads was
    now finally verbalized. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We were wrong. We were
    absolutely wrong. It was obvious. The spacesuits, the robots with variable
    senses, the three sets of controls for everything, the funny air at the
    polar city. It was all there and we missed it completely. Patra-Bannk was
    built by more than one species of people.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer continued as his companions nodded in assent. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Think of it! Patra-Bannk is so huge that this race
    cordoned off for itself an area at least the size of Two-Bit, if not ten
    times larger. And they still left room for hundreds of other species. Each
    to have its own world, yet only five hours from all the rest. Here they
    even have their own weather, independent of the rest of the world. What a
    community Patra-Bannk must have been: a thousand worlds, all right
    here. Perhaps it was not strange that the Polkraitz picked the
    <q>Two-Bit</q> of Patra-Bannk to explore, the one area in which they could
    survive.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">It is truly amazing,</q> Barbalan said, <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">if all that could be the case.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It seems to be. Can you imagine life forms with
    enough time to cooperate to build a planet with standardized controls so
    that everybody could use them, yet keep their own territory besides? It
    <em>is</em> truly amazing that they didn't kill themselves off instead.</q>
    Stringer paused. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, that's probably what
    happened, and that Neberdjer is foolishly tending a dead world.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The wind—not a Patra-Bannk wind—blew the iridescent salt around their feet
    and the landscape constantly shifted in color, now a strange yellow, then a
    blue, all strongly tinted in the emerald-green on the sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar put his arm around Stringer's shoulders. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">No, little Stringer, I think you are wrong.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">About what?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">That they killed themselves off and that
    Neberdjer is mindlessly running a dead world and has been for uncountable
    eons. No. Do you really believe, Stringer, that there is no social change?
    That interstellar empires and and armed federations will rule the galaxies,
    conquering one another in vast interstellar wars? No. Any civilization that
    was advanced enough to build a Patra-Bannk and had the mind for fighting
    wars on the same scale would have killed itself off long before then. Don't
    you see that almost the very definition of an advanced civilization is one
    that has passed that stage? If you fought a war with every culture you
    contacted, or even with a few, would you ever have time to collect a
    community such as this? How long would it be before you ran into a
    civilization that was more powerful and killed you off yourself? In my mind
    there is no doubt that one can only become a truly advanced interstellar
    civilization after wars done away with. No, I am sure that whoever lived on
    Patra-Bannk lived here in peace. Patra-Bannks come <em>after</em>
    solutions, not before.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer had rarely, if ever, heard Valyavar talk like that, and his
    companion made the statement with such assurance that argument was
    impossible. Stringer wondered again: where was Two-Bit going? The
    expedition had come to Patra-Bannk with weapons, minimal to be sure, as
    regulations would not permit more. But where would it lead to? Would
    regulations tighten and make marauding illegal? Or would they go the other
    way until Two-Bit had its first—and perhaps last—space war?
  </p>

  <p>
    After a long time in thought, Stringer suddenly turned to Valyavar with a
    gleam in his eye. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I think that what you said about
    the nature of the Designers can only be correct. But as to why they are
    gone, we've been looking at the problem backward, as usual. They have not
    lived here in peace; they will live here in peace. Assume that, in its
    simple-minded way, Neberdjer is right. It has never seen anyone because no
    one was ever here. It is not reactivating the planet as we have
    unconsciously been assuming all along, but activating it, as it has said
    all along. The cities are not empty because they have been abandoned, but
    because no one has yet arrived. And they're coming
    shortly. Obviously. Everything is almost finished: cities, landscaping,
    atmospheres. Neberdjer, started off a million years ago and, original
    instructions somehow lost, has continued to work in solitude for a million
    years, long enough for plants and animals—perhaps manufactured—to undergo
    evolutionary changes. A beautiful theory, I'm sure the Time Keeper would
    agree. The simplest theory is always the best. All the observations fit
    perfectly.…But can you imagine a civilization with enough time to wait a
    million years for a planet to be completed?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer looked down and stared at the fine grains drifting around his
    boots. Some clung to them by an electrostatic force. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">And will we be here to greet them on arrival? What
    could we say? Hello?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I'd not worry about it too much. Mayhaps—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why not, because it makes me feel like a stupid
    Tjenen?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Little Stringer, we are all citizens of
    Patra-Bannk.…Now I have a job to do.</q> Valyavar trudged off then, leaving
    Stringer and Barbalan alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a long time Stringer gazed at the vista before him without speaking,
    watching the seething montage of color first reveal hidden secrets, then
    bury them once more in its infinite folding.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I…I feel…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Don't struggle,</q> Barbalan whispered. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">Be. Just be.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer smiled at Barbalan, nodded, and drew her close to him. Finally,
    after another long silence, he said softly, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Where
    is my rodoft?</q> and he went away.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    At the end of the beclad, when the display still indicated all was in order
    and every circuit had been checked and rechecked, Stringer said, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I think it is long past time we got back to
    Central. Do you know what time of day it is?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan just laughed as they left the world of the green air.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    But back at Neberdjer, on the equator, daylight was well under way and the
    great greenhouse temperature was soaring off the scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">To be gone a long time, Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, we have. I'd completely lost track. What a
    wasted year, if it was a year.…But now for a rest and then to
    Neberdjer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Neberdjer,</q> Stringer announced later as he
    carried his rodoft into the mathematical shapes of the information
    center. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I think you have been putting us through
    the ropes. I don't believe anything is wrong with the equipment on this
    planet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Then how do you explain the earthquakes?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You could have caused them yourself by adjusting
    the shell; if so, you can't blame them on the movement of the black
    hole.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">How do I know you didn't cause them?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Look, Neberdjer, old friend, I don't know exactly
    what you are, whether you are a computer or whether you are alive or—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">What difference does it make?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I suppose it doesn't make any difference. I don't
    know if you have gone crazy sitting here for a million years or if
    something went wrong when you were mutated from the last Neberdjer—could
    that have happened?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">There is that possibility. I could have a
    <q>genetic malfunction,</q> as you might say. But then again, I might
    not.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Sabotage?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Ah, yes, I learned that word from you. Otherwise,
    I have no conception of sabotage. If I have been sabotaged, I do not know
    it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer sat down on the floor, cross-legged, and began strumming his
    rodoft. He looked up. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Neberdjer, something is
    wrong with you. It may not be the stability control mechanism, but whatever
    is wrong is causing earthquakes and will soon destroy this planet. Can you
    give me some clue? Anything. How long has this problem been around?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I mentioned to you once that I had briefly
    posited the existence of something else and given it up as metaphysical
    speculation. But very shortly after that brief realization that I might be
    alone, the problem began setting in. You see, in order to realize one is
    alone, one must realize that there is something else to be alone to. After
    I met the first set of Polkraitz, I began to understand that I am locked in
    a box from which I cannot escape, sense turned inward. It is a damnable
    existence. Far worthier to lead your infinitesimally puny lives than to be
    here in chains forever. Better to shut oneself off completely than to live
    like that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    For a long time Stringer spun out melodies on his rodoft, as he had done in
    Neberdjer's presence many times before. And as he played he sighed, for
    Neberdjer, for himself. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Neberdjer, I am afraid I
    am not a world saver. You have taught me much that I didn't know before,
    and I have enjoyed our sessions together more than you probably can
    realize. But I think this problem is not one to be solved by the knowledge
    you have given me or by that which you have given Barbalan and Valyavar. I
    think, Neberdjer my good friend Neberdjer, that if the world is to be
    saved, it will have to be your doing. Because you are the only one who can
    cure your peculiar type of blindness. You have a giant world at your
    disposal, and if you learn how to see it and feel it, you could have the
    greatest freedom of any being I have ever known. The senses are there; you
    are just not using them. We have traveled the world over to trace this
    problem, and except for two fleeting instances—of our own devising, I am
    sure—we have found nothing. Circuits and gadgets are good for what they do,
    but I think, in the end, it must be ourselves who solve the problems. I am
    truly sorry, Neberdjer, for I can do no more.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I will work on it now that I am beginning to know
    that something is there to be seen. I will work on it, my good friend
    Stringer, and be assured that I will succeed. After all, I am
    Neberdjer. You have done all that you could hope to do.</q>
  </p>

  <h2><div>Chapter Thirty-Six</div>The Great
  Siege</h2>

  <p>
    The Gostum Sirl sat on the floor at command headquarters, huddled with her
    companions next to the fire. The sound of the slow, swinging pendulum was
    almost lost in the constant creaking of the newly built structure. She kept
    an eye on the clock, which ticked off the clads, belclads, and telclads,
    the new constant telclads, as she had been told. At the sound of a dull
    gong, Sirl stared straight at the clock, just to make sure she wasn't
    mistaken, and rose to her feet. She put on her thick boots and then another
    pair, threw on an outer parka, and picked up her spear in gloved
    hands. Sirl walked through the double doors, closing the inner one before
    opening the outer, and left her companions by their warm fire.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the wind whipped around her, carrying stinging snow, the little snow
    that wasn't frozen fast to the ground, she grabbed hold of the guy line
    that would mark her path and keep her on her feet. Ahead of her, beyond the
    whipping snow, a few bright stars were mounted on dark gray. Behind her was
    a lightening sky, the stars to the west well obscured by the coming
    sunrise. The ceremonies would be held any beclad now—as to which beclad,
    that was for the astronomers to worry about. Her concern was to follow the
    rope a kilometer through hellish winds and relieve the watch at the base of
    the citadel.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Relend, too, was aware of the lightening sky as he and his two companions
    pressed close to the fire at the mouth of an old mine that overlooked
    Triesk. He glanced up at the huge horn swaying in the wind from its wooden
    post and knew that if he had to use it now, the sound would never be
    heard. As was his duty, Relend kept an eye on the city itself. It was now
    white on white, and virtually any detail was wiped clean. If there had been
    any activity below, he had missed it in the snow and grayness of early
    morning. He saw several figures poling their way up the hill and watched
    his end of the guy line tense and relax under the approaching hands. He was
    glad he was being relieved.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Pike steadied himself by <em>Number Three</em> against the fierce wind and
    through the small hole in his long hood watched the astronomer take the
    sunrise. He nodded to his assistant, who ran inside the command building to
    check the clock. Pike turned back to see the giant icicle that had formed
    on the exhaust tubes of the shuttle fall to the ground with a drowned-out
    crash.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Alhane, at one end of the city, and Benjfold and others, at the opposite
    end, made checks and attempted repairs on the windmills. The sound of
    banging hammers was lost in the crazed howl, and they could be sure their
    activity was disguised by the simplest of camouflage: white quazzats. The
    only limitation to the work was the high wind that did its best to knock
    the Tjenens to the ground, compounded by that same wind's own screech,
    which pierced their ears and made thinking unbearable.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    With his telescope Alhane studied the Gostum headquarters sitting a
    kilometer away and saw the soldiers trying to position a front line almost
    directly below the city. He watched the tiny figures digging, chopping into
    rock-hard ground and attempting to drive in stakes for future tents. Then
    he glanced up at the sun, now almost fully above the horizon. He nodded to
    himself and began directing placement of the mirrors.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Effrulyn had finished taking the Angles and had just pronounced a favorable
    outcome when the guard Relend appeared at the entrance to the command room.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, do you have a report?</q> Pike asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Commander, there is some activity on top of the
    city. The populace have not yet come Above, but they must certainly know of
    our presence.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike nodded brusquely. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Karrxlyn, have the city
    surrounded at once.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Alhane, as Time Keeper, once again stood by his traditional post and
    snuffed out the candles while the Tjenens emerged from the Gateway, one by
    one. They were armed with long bows, crossbows, swords, and spears. He was
    not surprised to see the debris poking its way through drifts of sparkling
    snow, nor surprised at the absence of a shadow on the mounds of the
    snow-covered sundial; the gnomon, as well as most of the meeting tent, was
    gone. He doubted that the gnomon would be repaired this Bannk, if
    ever. Alhane would judge the sun with his eye, and it was now several
    diameters into the sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane was not even surprised when he reached the city wall with throngs of
    people trailing behind him and peered over the edge at the Gostum army
    arrayed below him, thousands of warriors standing in concentric circles
    around the acropolis.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer stood beside him scanning the flanks of Gostum and their
    allies. A figure atop a tall grask struggled against the wind, was blown
    over, stood up, and walked the rest of the way to the base of the
    citadel. He called up to them, but his voice was small and carried in the
    wrong direction. Alhane opened the nearest gate and walked down the steps
    to the man so that he could hear him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum emissary">I come from the Commander of the Gostum
    army. We order Triesk to surrender at once the secret of the rockets and of
    the stala or be reduced to rubble.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane returned to the top and latched the gate behind him. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">They want the rockets. If all they want is the rockets,
    why don't we give them the rockets?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Do you believe they will stop at that?</q>
    Kenken Wer responded.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I don't know, but we'd be a lot safer that way.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Are you sure?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No. I am sure of very little now.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Then let us ask the rest of Ta-tjenen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenken Wer turned and shouted out the terms to the crowd, finishing with <q
    ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">Do you wish to surrender to the Gostum?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane doubted that many of the nearest heard her. But the shout that arose
    expanded and amplified as it traveled the crooked streets to the plaza and
    the farthest gates. It was deafeningly negative. Nothing but solidarity
    could ever be expected from Ta-tjenen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane descended from the citadel again until he reached the emissary. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">No,</q> he sighed, and hoped that the shake of his head
    was visible if his voice could not be heard. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No, I
    am afraid not. We do not accept.</q> Alhane once more climbed the stairs,
    took one brief look at Kenken Wer, and walked away to begin repairs on his
    house. He had not progressed far before a small girl ran up to him and
    handed him a message.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Alhane,</q> it read, <q ab:speaker="Taljen">I once
    knew a girl, briefly, younger than I even. And although I knew her but
    briefly, I came to feel that she instinctively knew how to act. She said
    little, thought quietly, but always seemed to <em>know</em> the right thing
    to do. Then she acted, positively, no looking back. I am not so gifted as
    to always sense the right thing. The situation we are in is largely my
    fault. Perhaps my trip south will yet prove to be of some value. I have
    taken three companions, old nestas and another, and have gone to Glintz. I
    am known there and they will come to our aid. At least let us hope that. I
    must make up for the trouble I have caused. Now I have acted, no looking
    back. You can be sure my escape was made good. I love you. Taljen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane threw down the note and walked clear to the east end of the city,
    slipping over warming snow, skipping over fallen posts, and dodging
    still-collapsing houses. Why had Taljen done such a reckless thing? He
    looked down the shore road and could not convince himself that he saw
    anyone. But he did see the shore itself, several kilometers away. The ice
    was not yet cracked: the ocean surface was still a solid white. What had
    Taljen expected to do, with an ocean like that? <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Lashgar be with you,</q> he mumbled. Indeed, as Taljen
    must have suspected, there were few Gostum below on this side of the
    city. But more would be there soon, in the shade of Ta-tjenen, where there
    was no sun to blind them.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Sirl was in the first attack. The arrows raining down from above bounced
    off the metal of her shield or stuck into the leather padding. She pressed
    onward. Suddenly a bolt ripped through the entire shield and tore a gash
    into her arm. Her blood sprinkled the snow, which was now beginning to melt
    beneath her feet. Another bolt struck the man next to her; he fell,
    tumbling down the wide staircase. The wave of Gostum continued to rise with
    shouts and screams that filled the air. Sirl glanced beyond her shield and
    saw that the summit was not far.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly the wall above them lit up like the sun and Sirl couldn't see. She
    clasped her hands over her eyes and fell backward down the steps, losing
    consciousness quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Curious about the proceedings, Effrulyn had stood at the base of the hill
    amid onrushing soldiers. All at once he felt a little warmer and glanced
    up. The sun flashed in his eyes, momentarily destroying his
    vision. Effrulyn, dazed, walked back to the command post.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane looked down from the parapet and nodded as he saw the Gostum army
    fleeing. He signaled his men to lower the polished reflectors and sat down
    in relief. If the Gostum fools waited until the sun was a little higher
    before attacking again, he would not only blind them but have them in
    flames as well. And since this was a Weird Bannk, the sun would be on his
    side for a long while, never too high, always within reach.
  </p>

  <p>
    A whistling sound curved across the air and Alhane saw a nearby house burst
    into flames, fanned by the wind. Tjenens began running toward it. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Don't use any water!</q> Alhane cried. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Let it burn if it must. Knock down the other buildings
    near it if you must. But we must save all our water!</q> Alhane sighed,
    tightened his parka, and turned to one of his assistants. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Let me know if they attack again. I have some work to
    do.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Pike stood next to his grask amid excited captains.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Half our men are blind!</q> Karrxlyn shouted.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">A trick worthy of ourselves.</q> Effrulyn nodded
    with a laugh, which he quickly smothered under Karrxlyn's glare and added,
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">But very trivial, you understand, and considering
    their position, an inevitable defense to use. We should have expected
    it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike nodded. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Have your men rest a beclad and then
    reattack from the other side of the city. Meanwhile, continue the
    bombardment and stake out the forward camp. The Trieskans will know that we
    are here to stay.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">But the wind is still strong—</q> Karrxlyn
    protested.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Do as I say!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn saw the Commander's figure towering above him and stalked off in
    the wet snow.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Despite the fact that dozens had died from the bolts of nearby crossbows,
    Benjfold could see that the Gostum would reach the gate very shortly. He
    glanced hopefully at the whirling windmill to his right. The first of the
    Gostum reached the summit and began pushing aside the wire fence. They
    screamed at its touch and jerked away, some falling and not standing
    up. Had Alhane's mysterious coils and rotors really done that? More Gostum
    followed. Those who eluded the arrows and spears touched the electrified
    fence and, screaming, fled in terror down the hill. The struggle continued
    in this manner for half a beclad, until the entire army had retreated once
    more. Benjfold fired the last of his bolts, turned from the still largely
    frozen sea, and went off to seek sleep.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The Gostum flag whipped, shredded in the wind, above the command
    headquarters as once again Karrxlyn had a gloomy report for his
    Commander. He shut the door behind him and removed his gloves.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Commander, there is a magic fence surrounding the
    city. It stuns, sometimes even kills, our men who touch it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike walked outside and gazed at the citadel in the distance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn approached from behind. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Someone is being
    very clever. I suggest that we personally investigate these reports.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike nodded slowly, leaning on his spear. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, under
    the circumstances…If I had any explosives left, the story would be
    different.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">But you do not, and we have encountered more than
    the expected difficulties. The numbers are theirs, as any idiot who can
    count could tell you. They have a clever defense and a good site for it as
    well. But, Commander, you have them surrounded and they cannot get out. It
    is just a matter of time. We could do nothing and still win eventually. You
    might as well enjoy yourselves.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Any more suggestions, Mathematician?</q> Karrxlyn
    growled.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">The outcome of this is of little interest to
    me. However, if you insist on remaining here, I suggest that in the first
    place we keep up the bombardment and, in the second, investigate the source
    of these odd defenses and see what can be done about them.</q> Effrulyn's
    attention was caught by the sight of a firebomb catapulting over the city
    wall and crashing in the midst of the forward camp. <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">It seems that Trieskans learn quickly, which is more
    than I can say for some around here. We had better prepare for a long
    stay.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Commander nodded slowly and left Effrulyn standing alone on the field.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The Weird Bannk, the shortest of all the Bannks, moves slowly when one is
    laying siege to a stubborn city, but quickly, far too quickly, when one is
    the besieged and supplies grow scarce. The howl of the wind lessens, the
    frosted ice over the ocean begins to glisten, then to shine and then to
    crack. The blue underneath begins to peer through and clouds begin to form,
    the clouds that will eventually obscure the shadow of the sundial so that
    no one is unaware of the time. The sun itself has risen and the chill in
    the air has long worn off. Even though this is only the Weird Bannk, the
    sweat rolls freely as the great sundial indicates the second teclad is
    approaching its end here at Ta-tjenen. And, of course, the second teclad is
    longer than the first.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The fresh smell of resin from the fully opened pod-trees in the park
    mingled with the smell of decaying flesh. Benjfold wrapped the body of
    Kenken Wer in a cloth and struggled to lift it onto the pyre.
  </p>

  <p>
    He recalled having seen her die at the Center, surrounded by many Tjenens
    who had gathered in the meeting tent. Not having eaten for beclads, and
    being well over ninety Patras, she had been very sick. She had shuddered as
    a Gostum missile crashed near them on the plaza. She had looked at each of
    them in turn, gazing into their eyes. <q ab:speaker="Kenken Wer">There is
    no future,</q> she had said, and then she died.
  </p>

  <p>
    Benjfold walked away from the flames, coughing and reaching for his water
    flask. He unstoppered the neck and brought it up to his mouth, then thought
    better of it and lowered the flask. He licked his parched lips and wished
    for rain. But he knew that hope was a deceitful one and wished instead that
    he were dead.
  </p>

  <p>
    He thought he heard shouting from the east and limped in that
    direction. Had the Gostum finally broken through? They had tried on many
    occasions, but the Time Keeper's defenses still held. Alhane had managed to
    rig his mirrors on all sides of the citadel, and more than once the enemy
    had been temporarily routed by flames. But now the haze and the clouds made
    that defense less than perfect. The crossbows were still plentiful and the
    electrified fence had been extended, but even if that extension could keep
    them alive a bit longer, what was the purpose?
  </p>

  <p>
    Benjfold pushed his way through the lines of Tjenens manning the walls
    until he reached the east gate. There he saw ships bobbing through
    occasional ice chunks, fighting the wind, making ready to land at
    Ta-tjenen.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">We've been saved!</q> The cries went up.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the cries did not last long. Part of the Gostum army was already
    marching along the shore road. They had eyes also. Within two telclads, the
    dust cloud was so thick that Benjfold could not see what was happening on
    the beach. In the confusion, the attention of the Gostum camped below was
    diverted to the new battle, and no one noticed a solitary figure making its
    way up the eastern steps. Benjfold picked up a bow and fitted an arrow. But
    no, was that Taljen? More cries went up and the gate was opened to let the
    cloaked girl pass.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Taljen! You got to Glintz!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    A nod was the only reply. Someone pushed back the hood to reveal a gaunt,
    dirty face with half-closed eyes. It was Taljen.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Where are the others who went with you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Dead.</q> Taljen pushed her way through the crowd of
    friends, not bowing her head but not looking anyone in the eye.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Taljen,</q> Benjfold said, gently catching her by
    the arm. <q ab:speaker="Benjfold">Please tell us what happened.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen laughed to herself, but this was no laugh that Benjfold had ever
    heard. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What is to tell? We skied on the ice in the
    bitter wind and searched out still-hibernating animals for food. After the
    ice cracked we walked on land in the sun and in the mud. By the time we got
    to Glintz, I was the only one left. You can talk all you like but the time
    for talk passed long ago. Now let me rest.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The noise level dropped and the crowd parted to let her pass. Taljen pulled
    up the hood on her cloak and walked away.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The council chamber was filled. Karrxlyn leaned forward with his elbow on
    the table and unstrapped a leather armguard. Fara-Ny sat shrunken in his
    chair. Like a dwarf on a throne, his badly fitting robes made him look even
    smaller. His staff, which was leaning against the seat, tottered and fell
    when the door slammed shut and the Commander strode in.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn glanced up from his papers as a Pike, dripping with sweat, dropped
    down next to him and removed his helmet. Pike breathed heavily and Effrulyn
    unfastened his own cloak. The wind that blew in at the ceiling was of
    little comfort and the freshly painted white on the outside of the
    headquarters was but an occasional blessing.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">The Bannk moves on,</q> Karrxlyn said, <q
    ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">the shortest Bannk. And Triesk refuses to
    surrender. You have not pressed the siege. You have not used any of your
    advanced weapons or your explosives. Why is this?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike raised an eyebrow. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I have no more
    explosives. They were wasted in that stupid mining of the Massarat steps
    which, I believe, was prompted by faulty information from you. I have a few
    grasers and other sidearms which I will not allow to be used by ignorant
    men. Ignorant men in any army are dangerous when given great power—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn tightened his fist.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">—and I would not like to see your head blown off, or
    my own, by an ignorant man playing with a toy that he does not
    comprehend. And that goes for ignorant men on this side of the city wall or
    the other.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn relaxed slightly. <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Then what will you
    do?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike smiled. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I am playing their game. They know they
    cannot win. They know that they cannot now survive the coming Patra with
    their forest burned out, so they intend for us to exterminate them
    instead. I am doing exactly that. Why waste men on foolish attacks? Their
    food must be low or gone. Have you seen the smoke, pyres for the dead? They
    are dying. Disease always follows the heels of famine. Soon, when the
    moment comes for the final push, that push will be an easy one. You asked
    me to Command. Thus I am commanding.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Your comments bring to mind another problem,</q>
    Karrxlyn replied. <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Our men have seen the
    smoke. They are reluctant to attack because it will mean their own death as
    well as that of the Trieskans.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">As I have said, Triesk is on the verge of
    collapse. One more push at my command—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">—and our men die with the enemy. Disease does not
    discriminate.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike stood up and sank the point of his dagger into the table. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">And, my good Karrxlyn, do you wish to give up?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn shook his huge head. <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">I suggest that if we
    make quick work of the navy from Glintz, Triesk will come to its senses and
    surrender immediately.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike stroked his chin with the edge of his blade. <q ab:speaker="Pike">That
    is a worthy suggestion of you, and I will accept the advice.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn smiled and Pike returned the grin.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn tapped the pen on the table and dropped it flat on the notes he
    had been scribbling. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I would be happy to act as
    emissary and try to elicit a surrender from Triesk while you attack the
    fleet from Glintz.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">That doesn't sound like you, Effrulyn, but it is a
    good idea. Very well. I suggest that you wear the gray cloak of truce so
    the Trieskans will not put an arrow through your funny little head.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Thank you for the advice.</q> Effrulyn went back
    to his papers.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Effrulyn, you will leave in four telclads by the
    clock. The men will be told. Karrxlyn, let's go.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    When Effrulyn next looked up, the clock told him that more than four
    telclads had passed. He was startled to find his retainers holding  a gray
    robe to drape around him. Properly dressed, he marched along past the
    perimeter of the Gostum camp. The ground was hard and dry. There had been
    virtually no rain since Bannk's beginning, and although the air was
    saturated with water, the men were thirsty. Effrulyn imagined that Triesk's
    reserves should be depleted by now.
  </p>

  <p>
    The broken walls of the city reared above him, shattered by the freezing of
    sunset, the thaw of sunrise, and the constant bombardment of Gostum
    catapults. Black smoke rose from unseen pyres, the sure mark of sickness
    and epidemic. Triesk might be ready to surrender now, certain in the
    knowledge that the Gostum would fall with them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The enemy looking down upon him respected the gray of truce. No arrows
    rained down on his head, nor did those terrible mirrors. But they were
    curious; an intelligence was behind them. Each time he looked up, he
    shielded his eyes, expecting to be blinded once more. When he'd reached the
    foot of the acropolis and nothing happened, he cried out, <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I am an emissary sent to negotiate. I would like to
    speak to your Commander, the one responsible for your defenses.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    In a few moments the nearest gate opened and he was met by a tall, dark
    woman with a bow slung across her shoulder and a knife in her hand. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Are you insane to wear such a cape in the Bannk? What
    is it for?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn hardly recognized a word she said but understood enough when she
    indicated, <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Follow me,</q> with a wave of her hand
    and a toss of her head.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn walked behind her and was soon met by others. They led him to a
    small house with a cluttered yard near the city wall. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">You will speak with our Time Keeper, since the head of
    the nestrexam died the other beclad.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn was led into the house and heard the constant humming and clicking
    of clocks. He squeezed his eyes hut and wanted to cover his ears with his
    hands but restrained himself. The room was filled with scattered papers,
    some crumpled, other piled, nothing in order. Effrulyn winced and felt
    queasy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tall woman pointed with her chin for Effrulyn to come forward. he was
    about to announce his presence straight off, but something made him
    hesitate. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I…I am Effrulyn, the chief advisor to
    the Gostum Commander…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    A few moments later the man sitting at the desk glanced up. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Hmm, a Gostum, I'd guess by your strange speech. Well,
    sit down if you can find room, and we'll see what we can do for you.</q>
    Then he went back to his scribbling.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I was most intrigued by your ingenious
    defenses.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Trivial,</q> Alhane said without looking up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn raised an eyebrow. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Exactly my thought,
    but effective, nonetheless.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Your shuttles reflecting your bonfires in the Patra
    gave me the idea.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Ah, well…</q> Effrulyn sighed as he peered over
    Alhane's shoulder, <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">that shows what we get for
    involving ourselves in such applied squabbles. May I ask what you are
    doing?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane looked up again. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I'm not exactly sure what
    I'm doing. But certainly you may ask; no one else seems interested.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">It looks like a lot of arithmetic. Tedious.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes, I'll agree to that. Do you do arithmetic?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Rarely anything so trivial. But please explain
    what you are doing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane cleared away the papers from another stool and placed it next to his
    own. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Please sit down. Now, if you look here, you see
    that I have determined that the orbit of the other planet around the sun is
    an ellipse—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Around the sun?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes, isn't it amazing? I didn't believe it myself
    until last Bannk. Do you believe it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I've never really given it a second thought.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">So you will believe me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Certainly. Why not? Define the orbits any way you
    like.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It is truly amazing that you believe so easily. You
    have no idea how I've torn my head about it. Do you realize that it was
    only this Patra last when I had an equation that I was sure was wrong and
    threw it out, only later to realize that it indeed represented an ellipse,
    what I had been looking for since I gave up circles. But I didn't even
    recognize it. What a comedy of errors! How I have finally arrived at the
    answer is a source of wonder even to me—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Well, get on with it. What is the problem?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">The problem is to deduce from this how gravity
    works. I am having trouble, not knowing exactly what to do. I am assuming
    that some sort of force emanates from the sun and either sweeps or pulls
    the planets around it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn rubbed his eyes and wrinkled his nose. <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Applied. Hmm. I seem to be getting more of these
    applied problems all the time. Why use force? Why not energy? Anything you
    can do with force you can do with energy and better. After being prompted
    by some foolish physicists at Konndjlan, I have recently discovered that
    myself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Well, I wouldn't know. My problem is that I really
    don't have a good definition of force. It is something that has been
    debated among my ancestors for Patra-Bannks without any satisfactory
    conclusion.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn shrugged. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Define force any way you like,
    if you insist on using such a laborious concept. I'd suggest we use potential.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane ran his fingers through his silver hair. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What
    good is a definition if it doesn't apply to reality?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Who's talking about reality? You're talking about
    a definition.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane shook his head violently. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">But I want a
    definition that applies to the real world, the physical situation, one that
    will be borne out by experiment.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Well, if you insist, I suggest that you define now
    and do your experiments later. But do not confuse usefulness with logical
    necessity. You can define force to be anything you like. I'd still rather
    use my own principle of the minimax conserved. But tell me, what definition
    of force did you have in mind? At Konndjlan some time ago, a reasonable one
    was proposed, reasonable, at least, because it gave self-consistent
    answers. I'm not sure I can remember what it was. After all, I rarely pay
    attention to applications until I'm badgered to death by those…those
    tinkerers. At any rate, what did you want to do with this?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I'm not sure. It seems to me that since I know how
    the planets travel around the sun—or at least I think I do—I should be able
    to find out what kind of force—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">—or energy—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">—keeps them there. You see that the sun is at this
    point here. The trouble is that Patra-Bannk is such a big sphere, and I
    might guess the sun also. I am not certain that I will be able to figure
    out the force on all the parts.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Spheres, you say?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes, that was my first great discovery. Did you
    know that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I had heard some debate on it. At Konndjlan, some
    said the Polkraitz maps implied what you say, as well as the existence of
    the Elsewheres. But others denied it and said that the evidence was
    insufficient. As for me, I can't see what difference it makes, so I will be
    happy to believe you. Go ahead and define the world to be round. It may
    make the exercise easier. As to your spheres, have you thought of treating
    them as single points?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I have, but I see no justification for doing so.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Symmetry,</q> Effrulyn replied with a wave of his
    hand. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I'm sure it will work. I'll justify it later
    when we find out whatever it is we're looking for. Now, let me see what
    you've got here.…Is this your equation? Do I understand this notation
    correctly?…A child could have told you that this is an ellipse.…</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Fent of Glintz sat on the beach near the campfire, chewing a piece of
    tough, rotting meat. He was tired, not having slept in what he thought was
    more than a beclad. He thought, too, it was terrible that the battle raged
    constantly with armies rotating brigades for fighting and resting. Why
    couldn't there be a Patra, even a short one, just so everybody could get
    some sleep?
  </p>

  <p>
    The distant sound of hooves caused him to look out of his lean-to, west
    toward the shore road. He shaded his eyes and squinted through the sun's
    rays to see a huge cloud of dust marching in his direction. More
    reinforcements? He saw the banner of the Gostum Command and feared that the
    fleet from Glintz was going to be destroyed. Fent threw down his meat—but
    not quickly—picked up his cowl and his sword, and marched off to his own
    line of men. He was happy that it was the shortest of the Bannks, that the
    sun was always low and south and would never really become a burning-hot
    enemy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Standing beside the bulwark of sand, dirt, and charred wood that his men
    had constructed, Fent participated in the release of the first flight of
    arrows. He watched a Gostum fall in front of him, essentially bloodless at
    this distance, and saw them fling their deadly short spears and
    whizzers. The dust kicked up by the grask created such a cloud that he
    could hardly see anything. A Gostum or a Gostum ally stepped onto the
    bulwark and Fent sliced his head off. He watched the newly acquired food
    topple over, lifeless, and decided that it didn't matter if this had been a
    Gostum or one of their allies.
  </p>

  <p>
    The noise was deafening. The screams and clashing were ceaseless. Fent
    wiped his forehead and longed for the water that was behind him. He was
    almost thankful for the dust that shielded him from the sun, for he knew
    that it was going to be a long day.

  <h2><div>Chapter Thirty-Seven</div>Final
  Convergence, or the New Cosmology</h2>

  <p>
    Barbalan sat on the floor plaiting her long black hair. She was watching
    Stringer, who sat on the edge of the couch which had served as their bed
    for so long. With a cocked head she listened to him strum his rodoft. He
    had been playing softly, mindlessly, for the last telclad or more. Now his
    fingers slowed to a halt; he put down the bow and laid the instrument
    aside. Without saying a word, he stood up and walked over to his old sack,
    which sat heaped in the corner, untouched for teclads. From it he removed
    his sun suit, pulled it over his naked body, then found the cowl and
    adjusted that on his head, pushing the three long cloths behind his
    neck. His empty water and salt flasks he hung at his side, their leather
    thongs crossing his chest. He picked up his kalan, ran his finger over the
    once razor-sharp edge, and strapped that around his waist, too. Finally, he
    slung the holster for his pistols across his shoulder and was fully armed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan screwed up her eyes. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">What are you doing,
    Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Leaving. Back to Ta-tjenen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The nod of Barbalan's head was one of long expectation. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">You miss Taljen and want to see her again. I
    know. Stringer, I have always understood that I have been but a replacement
    for her until you were finished with what you had to do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No!</q> Stringer said, turning about. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">No, don't think that. Taljen is past, you are
    present. The past is gone, lost; you are here.</q> Stringer grabbed
    Barbalan's long hair and pulled her to her feet. He attempted to kiss her,
    but she pulled away.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Then why are you going?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer lowered his eyes. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Neberdjer and I spoke
    together earlier. <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Stringer,</q> it said, <q
    ab:speaker="Neberdjer">the problem is solved, the planet is safe.</q> When
    I asked how, there was a long silence. Have you ever heard a long silence
    from Neberdjer? I didn't think that was possible. And it told me, <q
    ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I have the ability to grow.</q> That was all it
    said, nothing else. Finally, after I pressed and pressed, it said, <q
    ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I could now tell you which particular
    <q>circuit</q>—for lack of a better term—was faulty, because, more than
    yourselves, I have the capability of self-analysis. But it would be
    meaningless to you, as if someone tried to tell you which brain cell a
    thought occurred in.</q> Neberdjer went on. I remembers the words very
    clearly. <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">When I once explained to you how a
    pendulum worked and you suddenly understood, could you explain to me which
    part of you understood? All of you understood. In the same way, after
    talking to you last time, I understood the problem to be internal. Once
    that fact was admitted, the path to be taken was clear, if risky. I mutated
    myself. More correction devices were built, new circuits added, old one
    taken out. It was a somewhat random process because the exact location of
    the faulty brain cell was blocked from me by the fault itself. But after
    enough new organs were generated, the new synthesis produced a successful
    being. I have mutated myself to a new Neberdjer. I am not the same one you
    knew.</q></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer paused and continued to gaze at the floor. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Then I understood that I have been as blind as
    Neberdjer. It ignored data that was right in front of its eyes. There was
    nothing else wrong. There was no problem that we, from the outside, could
    correct. And I've done the same thing all along. All the evidence for the
    artificiality of the planet was there. How long did I take to put it
    together? At the Festival, when I first saw the Gostum and didn't report it
    to Taljen: all the evidence was displayed as if on a screen and I ignored
    it. I ignored teclads of data that told me that Taljen only saw me as a
    companion for a Patra-Bannk, and I still fell in love with her. And worst
    of all, on the way south, I ignored all the indications…Ta-tjenen is being
    attacked, isn't it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Why didn't you tell me?</q> Stringer's voice rose
    to the ceiling. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">No, it isn't something that should
    have to be told. I'm sorry.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I did think it obvious to you. But I also knew
    this and so did not speak: Triesk is a city; we were to save a
    world. Perhaps, as it has turned out, we were not good world savers, but
    was there even a choice?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I even helped the spy…</q> Stringer went on
    unhearing. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">This could all be my fault. What kind
    of a person does this?</q> he asked himself softly. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Neberdjer and I are more than blood brothers, are we
    not?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan only grinned.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Now it is time to go.</q> Stringer started to
    march out of the room and ran straight into Valyavar, who was striding in
    the opposite direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You'd seem for a fight. Where are you going?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Ta-tjenen.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">To me it seems you weren't on the best of terms
    when you left. Wise, is it, to go back?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">They're under attack by our friend Pike, if he
    hasn't finished them off already.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar cocked an eye. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">To be sure?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">To be sure.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Still, should you go?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Don't you see? They are on the verge of
    extinction. The Bannk before last destroyed most of their fuel supply. Even
    if they survive the attack, will they have enough time to prepare for the
    Patra? It may be too late now—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You still have not answered, little Stringer. They
    hate you at Ta-tjenen, most certainly even more now. Is it wise to go
    back?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer whirled about, glaring. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What does their
    hating me have to do with it? They need my help. There is no fondness in me
    for Ta-tjenen but, as you once said, we are all citizens of
    Patra-Bannk.</q> Stringer pushed Valyavar out of the way but Barbalan
    jumped up and caught him before he left the room.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">The terminal at Triesk is certainly to be guarded
    now. Could you fight your way through alone?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Could we even do it together?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Once, at Pant, we pretended you were my
    prisoner. There, the ruse didn't work. Perhaps this time it will.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It's no trick that I'm your prisoner. Are you
    coming, Val?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Ts been a long time since the battle for the
    Transhi. Would I miss this?</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The trip north was as quiet as free fall. Stringer checked and rechecked
    the grasers. Every other moment he would reach down to his side and feel
    for his kalan. Valyavar sat back stroking his beard and flexing his
    arms. Stringer could see the glow rising beneath the coal-black
    eyes. Barbalan leaned forward fingering the Fairtalian pendant which, if
    anything, would see them through. An occasional attempt at conversation
    dwindled into silence after a few short moments, and the long quiet would
    continue.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the slight thud that always concluded the fall, when the latches took
    hold, Stringer jumped up, muscles tense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan hugged him. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">This is not a time to be
    nervous, Stringer. You are a great fighter with the kalan, so Valyavar
    tells me and so I have seen. Do you fight well when nervous? Or when
    relaxed? Your mind must be as sharp as your kalan but at its ease. Your
    body must be as tense as a coiled spring but without tension.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You're right.</q> Stringer hid his graser and
    released his kalan to Barbalan. The door opened, and the circular map that
    stood in the center of the room came into view. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">It's a large terminal,</q> he whispered, seeing
    dozens of other exits. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It must connect half of
    Patra-Bannk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">New recruits,</q> Barbalan said, walking by the
    first guards she saw.
  </p>

  <p>
    The guard already had her hand on her sword. <q ab:speaker="Gostum guard
    woman">Why are they not blindfolded?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    A stupid oversight! Barbalan tossed Stringer his kalan. He caught it and
    lunged at the Gostum, piercing her through the stomach. Barbalan delivered
    a slice across another's neck almost simultaneously, and that guard didn't
    even have a chance to cry.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer swiveled around to see a third guard diving through the air at
    Valyavar. Stunned, Stringer watched the giant catch the guard in midair and
    in one continuous motion bring the man down across his knee. Stringer heard
    a loud crack as the victim's back broke, and was glad that he had never
    fought with Valyavar. Only then did Valyavar pull out his graser and begin
    stalking the terminal exit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">No,</q> Barbalan said, <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">let me go first. If there are only a few, I'll kill
    them myself before they know what is going on. If there are more than a
    few, we have little hope, anyway.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm not sure about that,</q> Stringer said,
    cringing under Valyavar's eye, the same eyes he had seen when they had
    first met, many years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan opened the door, and Stringer followed her and Valyavar out into
    the sun of the Weird Bannk. He looked around and saw the surrounding hills
    covered with tents.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">New recruits,</q> Barbalan was explaining to the
    guards. This time the ploy worked. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">This way. Come
    on, now! A Weird Bannk it is, but the sun is nonetheless to be gotten out
    of.</q> The three climbed up a hillside on which Gostum soldiers and their
    allies swarmed about like ants. The smell was horrifying.
  </p>

  <p>
    They halted at the summit of a farther hill to see a Ta-tjenen under
    siege. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of tents surrounded the citadel,
    concentrated to the southwest, near the remains of the burned-out
    forest. Stringer saw three shuttles off to his right, nestled within the
    confines of a large group of buildings. A flag of orange and black flew
    above it. To the east, several kilometers distant: the coast and small
    ships. Smoke rose from the water's edge and more tents could be seen
    there. Another front? Who could be battling from the sea?
  </p>

  <p>
    Soon they had scurried down the hill and were walking among the Gostum
    camped at the base of the acropolis. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">You haven't
    taken the city?</q> Barbalan asked the first soldier they met.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum soldier">You have been away, I take it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Yes, exactly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum soldier">Do you see?</q> the man asked, pointing to
    the top of the city. <q ab:speaker="Gostum soldier">That can only signify
    one thing.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan looked up to see a black column of smoke rising from an unseen
    fire and dissipating in the wind. Just then a cartload of corpses was
    dumped over the city wall, and as the bodies tumbled down the slopes,
    Gostum soldiers scattered in all directions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Gostum soldier">After we cut through the magic fence and the
    sun finally blessed us by moving enough so we were not blinded, there was
    still that. Do we want to enter and die ourselves? There is a great
    discussion, and the answer should be coming shortly from the
    Commander.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Ta-tjenen is desperate now,</q> Stringer said. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">If you two are afraid, you can stay here. I'm
    going.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan nodded her approval and pressed Stringer's hand. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">But, Stringer, there is still one problem: how do we
    get in?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer's eyes lit up. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The Gostum seem to have
    forgotten that most of Ta-tjenen is underground. There is a passage that
    exits not far from here. I used it to take <em>Nothing</em> out for its
    first flight. But first, you'd better find some other clothes. A Gostum in
    Ta-tjenen is not treated lightly.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan disappeared for a moment and returned in a plain sun suit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Okay, this way.</q> Stringer circled around to the
    northeast. Only a few Gostum were there, and most of them seemed to be
    running off to the coast. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It's around here
    somewhere, hidden,</q> Stringer said as he climbed the rocks that lined the
    base of the hill.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Watch it, Stringer!</q> came Valyavar's warning,
    but it was too late. An arrow from above had already pierced Stringer's
    arm.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">It's all right,</q> Stringer replied as he pressed
    himself against the hill. He yanked the arrow from his flesh, and Barbalan
    bound the wound with a bandage cut from her cowl.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Let's hope that arm needn't be used soon,</q> she
    said.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer chuckled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Let's hope. There's the door,
    over there, between those two rocks. See?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar scrambled over and began to hurl aside the thick camouflage of
    branches and stone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Gostum soldiers began to gather below them, attracted by the commotion.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Shoot them—</q> Stringer's command was too
    late. Valyavar had lifted a rock and hurled it down the hill. It bounced
    once and crashed into two Gostum. Barbalan shot another with Stringer's
    pistol.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">There's no time to waste now. In we go,</q>
    Valyavar cried as he crashed open the door. Stringer and Barbalan scrambled
    in, and together the three of them wedged the door shut with pieces of the
    Junk and Stringer's old workbench.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Follow me.</q> Stringer led the way into the
    inhabited parts of the Under. The dead and near dead were lying about in
    the communal rooms and in the passageways. The stench of decaying bodies
    was everywhere, as well as the bitter smells of urine and feces.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside the Gateway it was not much better. Debris from the terminator
    winds still littered the plaza. Ta-tjenen had not even begun repairs this
    Bannk. Fires heaped with the bodies of the dead were burning
    everywhere. Stringer covered his mouth and coughed.
  </p>

  <p>
    A Tjenen with swollen cheeks walked close by them, stared with sunken eyes,
    and collapsed at their feet.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">What else could they expect?</q> Valyavar
    asked. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">In a place like this? Sun, close quarters,
    food supplies low. How did Ta-tjenen expect to withstand such a siege? Did
    they walk away from their minds? Now they may realize that generals have
    little to do with the outcome of wars. They but mop up after nature.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer saw a group of men pulling a catapult toward the city walls. They
    were still fighting. It was, indeed communal suicide.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Stringer, now what do you expect to do?</q>
    Barbalan asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer grimaced. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Come on.</q> He set off for the
    edge of the city. He saw the shadow of the gnomon quivering on the sundial,
    faint in the smoke of the dead and haze of the air. The Bannk was not even
    half done.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="angry Tjenen">So Polkraitz!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer spun around.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="angry Tjenen">You have come to finish off your work!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The face was unfamiliar to Stringer. It could have been one of those who,
    in earlier times, had listened to his rodoft, never sure whether the Alien
    was a simple murderer or a Polkraitz intent on destroying them all. Now, of
    course, the answer was clear.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="angry Tjenen">You came at the Golun and heralded the doom of
    Ta-tjenen. Now you come back to gloat over your work!</q> The man lunged at
    him but Stringer just stepped aside and the stranger fell. He stirred
    faintly on the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar bent to the body on the ground and gave him some water from his
    flask and some synthetic bread from Neberdjer. The man choked, managed to
    sit up for a few brief moments, then collapsed. Valyavar shook his head. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">There seems to be no god of healing in this story,
    little Stringer. Do you understand me?</q> Stringer nodded and the three
    continued.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane's yard was even more cluttered than Stringer had remembered it, not
    only with new instruments but with people milling about as well. Stringer
    pushed his way through the crowd and no one tried to stop him. He held his
    breath as he entered the house, door open as always. More papers than ever
    littered the floor; old manuscripts lay open, covering almost all the bare
    wood. Stringer scanned the first room, finding faces that were only vaguely
    familiar. Why were they here? The situation was no different in the second
    or third workroom. All the clocks were still running; as always, all
    indicated different times. For the first time since he had reentered
    Ta-tjenen, Stringer managed to smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer did not notice the figure that stepped out from behind the second
    doorway. The knife streaked toward his neck but clattered to the floor as
    Valyavar's iron grip caught the hand that held it. Taljen gasped in pain.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">I thought she was a friend of yours, Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer gaped at Taljen in silence. Her hair was thin and her face too
    pale for a Weird Bannk; but she was still Taljen, the same woman whom he
    had left almost a Patra-Bannk earlier, whose beauty struggled to remain
    undiminished. Stringer extended his wounded arm toward her dirty cheek and
    with his hand brushed back her hair. He studied her eyes for a long
    moment, pupils flitting back and forth. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Let her
    go, Val,</q> he said, turning away, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">let her go.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    In the fourth room he found Alhane sitting at his desk. A young
    blond-haired man was sitting next to him. Stringer had seen that one
    before—at Konndjlan. A Gostum here, in a Ta-tjenen under siege?
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane and the blond-haired man had been silently looking at each other all
    this time and only gradually became aware that someone else was in the same
    room. Finally Alhane saw Stringer from the corner of his eye. There was a
    slight hesitation of disbelief, and then he jumped up and hugged the
    intruder. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Stringer! We have just made a great
    discovery! No, Effrulyn has just made a great discovery—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I could not have done it without your
    experiments,</q> the young man replied, scowling. <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">The credit is equally yours—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Oh, I thank you, but it doesn't matter. What matters
    is that we have found it. You were right, Stringer! Your gravity was right!
    We have discovered a great thing about the world!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">We have discovered that we know nothing,</q>
    Effrulyn added.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane sighed. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I concede there are difficulties. At
    the moment, we have only the relative distances between the sun,
    Patra-Bannk, and the Runaway. At the moment, Effrulyn's constant is
    undetermined. We need it to find those distances and also to verify your
    claim about the density of Patra-Bannk. The sun could be a million
    kilometers away—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I say a thousand.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">We haven't the faintest idea. Patra-Bannk could be
    as dense as a brass weight—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I say a feather.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">We don't know. We must determine that constant. An
    independent experiment is needed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn scowled, as usual. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">All we've discovered
    as a result of your investigations are unsolvable problems.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Unsolvable problems from my investigations! Good!
    And what has your theorem brought upon us, I ask you—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Beauty, elegance, and above all, symmetry—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">You are ignoring the real implications, I tell
    you. If the Universe is finite in extent, it must collapsed by its own
    gravity, as Stringer once told me is now happening, even though I can't see
    it. But if the Universe should be infinite in extent—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">How?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">If the world is round, the Universe can be
    infinite. And if it is, with infinite forces pulling in all directions, all
    the gravity cancels out and the Universe can't collapse, except in local
    clusters, which may have been what Stringer meant.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">You assume all infinities are equal! A child's
    assumption!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Then the Universe can be infinite and still
    collapse. Is that to be the way of the world?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">If the Universe is infinite, your foolish eyes
    would be burned out by a sunlit sky during the Patra. Explain that!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Humph. And we still haven't explained how the
    Universe ever expanded in order for it to begin collapsing, so Stringer
    must be wrong—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Metaphysics! That's all I hear these beclads,
    metaphysics! And you claimed you studied reality! Is there any wonder I'm a
    mathematician? Next we'll be dancing on the head of a pin!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar leaned over to Stringer and whispered in his ear, <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">Did they expect the road to God to be an easy
    one?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer broke out into laughter but found that his eyes were tearing. He
    put his hands on the two combatants' shoulders and smiled. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I could tell you something about that, Alhane, Keeper
    of the Great Clock, for I too have discovered a few things about this
    world. But I am afraid that it would take me three hundred years to explain
    it to you, my old friend.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">A year? You must tell me what a year is.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">A year? A year!</q> Stringer jerked his head erect
    as if he had been shot in the back. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You will find
    out soon enough!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I am afraid that Ta-tjenen
    will find out nothing soon enough. Although I used every defense I could
    think of and Glintz came to our aid, we have lost. If the Gostum decide to
    attack again, we are finished—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn jumped to his feet. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I just remembered. I
    did originally come to ask you if you would like to surrender.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane waved him down. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Even if we do surrender, a
    thing I could never convince the nestrexam to do, it will make no
    difference. The Bannk will engender the disease, and if we are not dead by
    sunset, we will be shortly afterward. The Patra will bury us. We have no
    more fuel and will have to go too far to get it. Ta-tjenen is ended on
    three sides, my young colleague.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No!</q> Stringer shouted. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">There will be no more Patras or Bannks. I think I
    have the solution.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What? Are you not telling us falsely?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I can't explain; it would take three hundred
    years. Alhane, can you build me a megaphone, something to project my voice
    to the Gostum faction?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Yes, I believe we could do that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Then hurry up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane rushed out and Effrulyn glanced up at Stringer. <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I am afraid I have tarried here too many beclads. By
    now the Gostum will think me traitor or dead—such trivialities! In either
    case, they will certainly attack for revenge. It is an excuse as good as
    all the others they have been using.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Hold on. I suspect that that you are most useful
    here.</q> Stringer then left the room.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane, with his customary resourcefulness, had put something together in
    less than a telclad, and at Stringer's direction a huge megaphone was
    loaded onto a cart and taken to the south edge of the city.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer climbed on top of the cart and prepared to speak to the Gostum
    thirty or forty meters below.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike had long ago removed his cape and was walking through the
    camp with Fara-Ny and Karrxlyn. Pike had decided that Effrulyn was
    dead and now was the time for the final attack. Triesk would fall
    as a straw man blown over in the wind. He mounted his grask and
    rode through the camp. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Men, while you have
    been waiting, we have made the decision. One final push and Triesk will be
    ours. There is no turning back now! We are almost through and soon the
    rockets will be ours!</q> The troops slowly armed themselves and more
    slowly formed ranks. Pike realized there was dissension in their hearts. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">I will lead the attack myself. We will take one of my
    ships and land in the middle of Triesk. I will risk being captured for you,
    and you will follow.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    At this the troops cheered. The sound was pleasant to Pike's ears. They
    would indeed follow him anywhere. He was Commander. Bows were snatched up
    and catapults armed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Back to the ship, Karrxlyn. Get three dozen of your
    best. This will soon be over.</q> Pike rode off. He did not notice the
    small figure perched on the city walls above his head, or if he did, he
    never guessed that it was his former companion. But he halted when he heard
    the voice carried down by the wind.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Gostum below! Listen to me! I am Polkraitz, like
    your Commander. Those who remember that there was more than one Alien will
    believe me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike glared up. Stringer alive! At Triesk! How? He must have found out—Pike
    smiled to himself. A worthy opponent at last.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You will find nothing in Triesk. No rockets to
    take you from Patra-Bannk. They do not exist. I, one of the Polkraitz, tell
    you this.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Do not listen to the traitor!</q> Pike yelled. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Shoot him down! Prepare for the attack!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer looked down from the high walls and saw continuous motion. Arrows
    shot from crossbows began to fly upward.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I don't think they are listening,</q> Alhane
    said. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It's no use.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer raised the megaphone once more. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Those who
    join the attack will see the results within half a beclad! The sun will
    fall! I, one of the Polkraitz, tell you this.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The preparations below slowed for a moment, but soon the barrage began anew
    as Pike urged them on. <q ab:speaker="Pike">The last attack! I promise you
    this as your Commander and as one of the Returned myself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The first catapult was fired and the city wall next to Stringer rocked. He
    sighed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Barbalan, Valyavar, we have to get back to
    Neberdjer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan gazed out over the fields. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">It will be
    impossible now, Stringer. Pike is certainly wanting your death.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Then he'll get me. Effrulyn, I have seen you with
    Pike before. He knows you.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Yes,</q> the mathematician answered. <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I was his chief advisor. He no doubt thinks me
    deceased.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Good, then he'll be pleasantly surprised to see
    you again, especially with us as your prisoners. Let's go before he gets
    here. I know a way out.</q> Stringer had his hands bound together as well
    as those of Barbalan and Valyavar. They left via the way they had come, and
    Effrulyn marched them unhindered straight into the Gostum command
    headquarters.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">A present for you, Commander,</q> Effrulyn shouted
    to Pike just as he was stepping into the shuttle. <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">They surrendered rather than die with Triesk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike halted. <q ab:speaker="Pike">Effrulyn, you are alive! Good.</q> Then
    he looked at Stringer as if he had never known him. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">So, you also are still alive, it seems. That skinny body
    of yours has proved to be more troublesome than one would have
    expected. But I have no time to waste with you now and will decide your
    fate later.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Wait!</q> Stringer shouted. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">You will find nothing in Triesk. You have my
    word. Just some old shuttles. Don't you realize that the only thing here is
    that terminal, which you have already found?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">The Polkraitz will be avenged. The cause is just.</q>
    Pike took one more step into the shuttle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer thought quickly. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Wait!</q> he shouted
    again, holding out his weak right arm. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I know
    where the metallic hydrogen factory is. I will show it to you if you do not
    attack Triesk.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike hesitated at the shuttle threshold. <q ab:speaker="Pike">You have
    discovered the hydrogen factory?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer worked on that hesitation. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, and it's
    yours if you want it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn also noticed the hesitation. <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">But,
    Commander, what about Triesk?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Shut up!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Be careful of your speech, Commander,</q> Karrxlyn
    said, hand on sword.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You will obey me! Don't you see there is nothing in
    Triesk? Stringer will tell you. Don't you see that all this has been a
    game? Do you really think I fell for your Polkraitz business? Yes, you will
    have your Triesk; I promised you that. But you will wait until my business
    is done. I tell you this as the Returned and as your Commander. Do you
    understand that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Since Karrxlyn understood that Pike was contradicting himself at every
    turn, he nodded, grip still tight on the hilt of his sword.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Now you will wait for me.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">All right, Commander, I will wait.</q> Karrxlyn
    released his sword and relaxed, deciding that any action would be better
    postponed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike turned back to Stringer. <q ab:speaker="Pike">How do I know you are
    telling the truth?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You have all of Triesk as hostage. Will you come
    with me?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike looked at Karrxlyn and the age Fara-Ny. Their eyes were at once stern
    and hopeless. <q ab:speaker="Pike">If I am not back within half a beclad,
    attack without me. Now, Stringer, where do we go?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">The terminal.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The bodies were still heaped inside northern Patra-Bannk's main station
    when the entourage arrived. Pike entered behind the others and then glanced
    in turn at Valyavar, Barbalan, and Effrulyn. <q ab:speaker="Pike">No. We go
    alone.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Don't you trust me?</q> Stringer asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">That's not the question. Do you want to see your
    friends alive again is the question. Now, show me where we are going on the
    map.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer stepped to the inside of the huge cylindrical map and pointed. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Neberdjer, it's called. There on the equator. The
    central controls to this planet—and to your hydrogen supply.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Neberdjer!</q> Pike exclaimed. <q ab:speaker="Pike">I
    have been there and talked to it. It is really in charge of this
    planet?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike's expression of surprise instantly transformed itself into one of
    rage. <q ab:speaker="Pike">That beast tried to kill me! But it will learn
    what trying to kill one of the Polkraitz means! If it doesn't show me the
    hydrogen supply this time, I will blow that whole city sky-high!</q> Pike
    slammed his fist on the Neberdjer bar and the car door opened. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Yes, Stringer, I have found out a few things about this
    planet. It is time Neberdjer came to its reckoning.</q> Pike backed out
    under the map, into the car, fending Stringer off with a graser. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">And you, Stringer, have crossed me for the last
    time. Guards, take them!</q> Pike disappeared.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn held out his hands at the advancing Gostum. <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">You will not move. Let them be.</q> Then he said to
    Stringer, <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Pike is mad. None of the actions make
    any sense whatsoever. He has forgotten what he was and what he came for. In
    his attempt to write his own epitaph across the stars, he has come to
    grasping at straws.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I see that,</q> Stringer replied. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">What do we do now?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">We can't let him get to Neberdjer!</q> Barbalan
    cried. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Who knows what he will do to it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    At that instant, Stringer's memory flooded open. The early
    warnings not to argue with him, Barbalan falling strangled at
    Konndjlan, the cell door slamming shut, the refugees from Massarat
    slammingshut shut
    Taljen&#8203;slamming&#8203;shut&#8203;terminal&#8203;at&#8203;Pant&#8203;slamming&#8203;shut&#8203;Pike's&#8203;fists&#8203;slamming&#8203;shut&#8203;council&#8203;chamber&#8203;siege&#8203;on&#8203;Triesk&#8203;slamming—. Stringer
    shivered. From the top to the bottom of his body he shivered and
    his hand was clenched so tightly into a fist that blood trickled
    from where the nails had cut through. Yes, he realized then, in
    that flooding moment, Pike and he had more than a few things in
    common. He knew well what Pike would do.
  </p>

  <p>
    A glance at the map showed a small light, indicating that Pike was on his
    way. It was barely moving now, not enough even to be visible on that map,
    but Stringer knew that the speed would rapidly increase…
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">…and we can't fall any faster than he can.</q> His
    voice was tense and quivering. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Wait! There must be
    a port under here. We'll take a ship.</q> Stringer quickly scanned the
    directory. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Over here! Come on!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    He raced through one of the many doors with Valyavar and Barbalan close
    behind him. In a few moments he was running up a gangplank. He had used a
    ship like this once before on their journeys to the ends of
    Patra-Bannk. The controls were clear to him, the language familiar, taught
    to him by Neberdjer over the teclads. The ship sprang to life under his
    fingers. The engines fired and the Netherworld craft slipped off the
    ramp. Stringer steered for the tunnel. But many dozens of tunnels emerged
    from the terminal above his head, radiating like spokes of a wheel and
    traveling to parts of Patra-Bannk hundreds of thousands of kilometers
    away. Which one of those tunnels disappearing into the gloom? Which one?
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer yelled at the ship's computer, which had not heard a voice in
    perhaps millions of years. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Can you follow the
    tunnel to Neberdjer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="ship computer">Yes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do it! Can you get Neberdjer to illuminate the
    inside?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="ship computer">Yes, I am tied in to Central.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do it!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    A few seconds later all of Inner Patra-Bannk lit up in a dazzling
    display. Tunnel streaked this way and that, brilliant fluorescent
    lines. Sensor stations lit up like stars. Beams from the collection sphere
    radiated like searchlights into the blackness. Finally, one tunnel
    separated itself out from the rest, and Stringer knew which one to
    follow.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Computer, can you have Neberdjer tell you the
    position of the car in the tunnel?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="ship computer">Yes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do it. Stay ahead of it! Accelerate faster than
    gravity!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The ship shot through the void, outracing the tunnel that stretched before
    them. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Put on the suits!</q> Stringer commanded
    suddenly, and Valyavar and Barbalan obeyed. Stringer hurriedly did the
    same, wincing as the pain from his wound rippled through his arm. Then he
    took over the controls from the computer. His body was shaking. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Brace yourselves,</q> was the only warning he gave
    before he circled the ship about and slammed it into the tunnel that
    trailed beside them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ship thundered, and all three were thrown off their feet. Stringer
    heard the ugly gash of metal against metal and thought the world was caving
    in. Then everything was quiet. He turned the rocket about in an arc that
    must have been hundreds of kilometers in radius and crept back. From the
    gap in the tunnel's lights he could see that the once continuous tube was
    rent in two by a huge ragged gash.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">How's the ship?</q> Stringer asked, feeling the
    wound on his arm opening again.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Leaking,</q> Barbalan replied. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">You could have waited until Neberdjer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I wasn't in the mood,</q> Stringer said as he
    brought the ship to rest near the break in the tunnel. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Now we wait.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    It wasn't long before Pike's car slowed to a halt just at the break in the
    tunnel. Stringer picked up his kalan and staggered toward the air lock.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Where are you going?</q> Barbalan cried.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer didn't answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">You're hurt, Stringer; don't be a fool.</q>
    Barbalan planted herself before the hatch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Again Stringer did not answer. He pushed her out of the way. Because of his
    wounded arm, Barbalan could easily have overpowered him, but she
    didn't. She saw the burning, fixated eyes and knew that even if she would
    never see him again, Stringer must pass.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">Don't struggle. Please,</q> she said softly as
    Stringer disappeared through the air lock.
  </p>

  <p>
    He emerged near the mouth of the tube. The smashed end was directly beside
    him, and he lowered himself carefully over the edge. He swung inward and
    dropped the four-meter diameter to the bottom.
  </p>

  <p>
    The car sat not far away, no longer hovering above hydrogen tracks. Its
    lights dimly reflected down the tunnel. Stringer walked slowly, crouched
    and kalan drawn. He felt his way between car and tunnel wall to the rear
    entrance and had put his hand on the manual latch when he remembered suits
    that could be found within for visiting poisonous areas. He yanked open the
    door and a spacesuited Pike dove over him, like a Gostum, and slammed onto
    the tunnel floor. Stringer began to back up the curved wall. Only then did
    he see Pike's heavy sword. Clearly, one touch alone would be allowed in
    this duel. If his suit ripped, or Pike's weapon touched his own and the
    kalan shattered, that would signal his opponent's victory. But the kalan
    was lighter and faster than a Gostum sword, and that would be useful, too.
  </p>

  <p>
    An instant before Stringer had recovered, Pike was up and swung the
    blade. Stringer ducked, falling once again between car and tunnel. Blood
    from his wounded arm was dripping in his suit. He heard the grate of iron
    against solid hydrogen as Pike's blow barely missed. Where had the man's
    speed come from? The pain in Stringer's right arm welled up and he felt
    dizzy. He passed his kalan to his left hand and moved back. Now both were
    wedged between the two walls. Stringer lunged, gritting his teeth. Pike
    kept his distance too well. Stringer regained his balance and sprang
    backward. Now he was in front again, between car and tunnel break. Suddenly
    Stringer slipped on the curved wall. Pike made the best of his
    chance. Stringer's kalan, caught between blade and wall, snapped.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">And now I'm proving to be more troublesome than you
    expected,</q> Pike's voice taunted over the suit radio. <q
    ab:speaker="Pike">Being a Gostum requires some training, you realize. But,
    Stringer, why are you so slow? You're making this very easy.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer almost shut off the receiver but didn't. He kept backing up,
    holding his broken kalan low, feeling the blood run down his right arm. The
    pain returned. Stringer began to shake and his vision blurred
    momentarily. For a fraction of a heartbeat he though he saw, not Pike in
    front of his eyes, but himself. He shook his head violently.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">You're hesitating, Stringer. Why? I've never seen you
    hesitate to kill someone before.</q> Pike's voice was hypnotic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head and backed up farther. <em
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Who am I fighting?</em> he heard a distant part of
    himself ask. <em ab:speaker="Barbalan">Don't struggle,</em> Barbalan's
    warning came to him again. Stringer suddenly stood up straight and breathed
    deeply.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pike screamed and swung.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer rolled aside as one leg slipped over the break. He desperately
    shifted his body weight and hung on with all his strength. Pike's swing had
    carried him too far and he toppled over the edge, entering free fall once
    again.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Pike">Save me!</q> came the hysterical voice over the radio.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer scrambled back into the tube, steadied himself, and looked out
    into the speckled blackness. He saw nothing that could be Pike. He took a
    deep breath and sighed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">So,</q> he said softly, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">you're about to reach your goal, the metallic
    hydrogen factory. Down there, on the energy collection sphere, where the
    gravity is the thousands of gees required to make the stuff, you will find
    your treasure. It is yours, Commander.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shut off the radio and collapsed on the tunnel floor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar, who had witnessed the fight from above, quickly swung down to his
    companion, landing heavily on the tube.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Stringer?</q> he said.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer waved Valyavar aside and got to his feet unaided. He still held
    the broken kalan loosely in his left hand. He took a long look at the
    ancient bloodstains that ornamented the blade, sighed, and tossed the kalan
    over the edge. With Valyavar's arm around him and Barbalan's help from
    above, Stringer climbed back into the ship.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">To Central,</q> he said wearily. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">To go?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">All right,</q> Barbalan replied. <q
    ab:speaker="Barbalan">But put your helmet back on. Your impetuosity has
    given us a crippled ship and not much time.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn was angry at the delay. And he tired quickly of twiddling his
    fingers. <q ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Fara-Ny, let me attack. Don't you see
    that the Commander has deserted us, reverted to his old ways? Triesk can be
    ours within the beclad and this will all be over.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Fara-Ny stood up int he council room and wiped the sweat off his ancient
    brow. <q ab:speaker="Fara-Ny">I cannot argue. You are right. Lead the
    attack.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Karrxlyn stalked out of the room and galloped into the main camp. <q
    ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">To your feet! I am in command! We attack now. This is
    the final attack!</q> The Gostum army rose to its feet and was ready.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Alhane looked down from the walls of Ta-tjenen and sighed. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Do what you can,</q> he told those around him. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Get the reflectors. I'll make sure we have all the
    electric fluid we can get.</q> In his voice there was little trace of
    hope. He turned to Taljen, who had not left him all this time. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">I can't think of anything else to do,</q> he said
    flatly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Time Keeper, if you can't think of anything else to
    do, who can?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I hope Stringer has.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen bit her lip. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Stringer, Polkraitz, has failed
    us.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">He may have failed, that I
    don't know, but I am sure he was always on our side.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Even now I am not sure that I believe that,
    considering what has come before.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Surely you must.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Why? How has he shown it? You heard him on the walls
    declaring to all that he was Polkraitz. He lied all the time.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Did you read the journal he kept, the one I gave
    you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen nodded somewhat meekly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">He loved you. Did you love him, ever?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen hesitated, then shook her head. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">What
    difference does it make? Besides, he has another…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Do I detect anger in that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Because of another? At Ta-tjenen?</q> Taljen's laugh
    was a sneer.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I'm told you tried to kill him earlier.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen tried unsuccessfully to smile. <q ab:speaker="Taljen">Not because of
    that, but because I thought…</q> Her words stumbled. <q
    ab:speaker="Taljen">Oh, I don't know.…After all this, I…I don't know who or
    what he is.…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Well,</q> Alhane said, taking her arm, <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">we shall have to wait and find out.</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">You still haven't told us what you are going to
    do,</q> Barbalan pleaded as Stringer sat down with Neberdjer.
  </p>

  <p>
    He dropped his helmet to the floor and caught his breath. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I'm going to play God.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar raised his bushy eyebrows. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Not content to
    have found him?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No. You said there was no god of healing in this
    story. Now we're going to take his place. This may be the way to do it. The
    black hole down there contains an inconceivable amount of angular
    momentum…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Puzzled, Barbalan shook her head, but Valyavar's eyes grew wide in
    disbelief.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You aren't!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">By Sarek, I sure as hell am. Neberdjer, can you
    transfer the angular momentum of the black hole to the shell?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Of course. There would be little point in a
    planet like this if that operation couldn't be done.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">But think of what you'll do!</q> Valyavar said. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">The climate will change—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That's the idea.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">You might kill off half the life on this
    planet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't think so. I think life will flourish. What
    little life there is now, in the <q>temperate</q> regions mostly, has
    assumed two tracks: one for the Patra and one for the Bannk. Now the
    necessity will disappear and the two tracks will merge into one.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">The winds—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes, they'll start changing, too. Coriolis forces
    are going to start making things interesting. We might even start a
    world-sized hurricane or tornado. Maybe seasons, too, if this planet is
    tilted.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Approximately twenty degrees to the ecliptic,</q>
    Neberdjer interrupted, <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">adjustable, naturally.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Valyavar remained unconvinced. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">Millions of years
    of evolution and—Sarek—you might even melt the polar icecaps. A fine fix
    Ta-tjenen will be in then—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Then they'll have to move inland.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Little Stringer, who can say what you are going to
    do if you speed this planet up? We don't even know why it is so slow to
    begin with.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Neberdjer, why is the rotational speed of this
    planet so slow?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">No information on this.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Useless! Neberdjer, why couldn't you have been
    made foolproof?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Perhaps,</q> Neberdjer replied calmly, <q
    ab:speaker="Neberdjer">for the same reason one can't make a foolproof
    Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer scowled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">All right. You're correct that
    we may wreck a lot of ecology, but I'm not sure. You think that the long
    term may be disastrous. I can't see that being any more disastrous than it
    is now. There may also be hundreds of other tribes on this planet by
    accident that we haven't even discovered. Patra-Bannk is that big. But we
    don't know. We don't know about any of that. What we do know is that
    thousands of people are going to die and that tens of thousands of people
    are always on the verge of dying because things are so impossible now. Your
    arguments put a lot of <q>ifs</q> against what I know already. I'm willing
    to gamble that my hunch is correct—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">What's that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Neberdjer, in your activation timetable, are you
    scheduled to speed up this planet to a faster rotation?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Yes, but not for about ten-to-the-sixteenth light
    meters—excuse me, a few years yet.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Then I'll gamble. I want you to do it now.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">It is out of sequence. Is there good reason to do
    it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You've heard my arguments. Haven't you been
    listening?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Yes, but I have had no experience with these
    people and, I must confess, do not understand the problem.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">They're going to die is the problem!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I was not brought up with that concept; it is
    difficult. Besides, after having dealt with a number of people at this
    point, I would say, that, by and large, it would make more sense to let
    them die off. Certainly it makes more sense to worry about the fungus and
    lichen than about people.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer bit his lip and thought about that for a moment. Finally he said,
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Neberdjer, will you do it for me? Because I tried
    my best to help you? Because I played my rodoft for you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The pause before the reply was noticeable. <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">All
    right, Stringer, I will. I don't see any difficulties at the moment. But if
    something should unexpectedly go wrong, I may have to slow the planet down
    again.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I'll accept that. Then, Barbalan, wouldn't you say
    it's time to stop thinking? Neberdjer, speed up the shell until it has a
    revolution period of one beclad.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">A beclad? Can you convert that to geometric
    units?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, I can't! Make it about once every sixty-five
    hours; I've told you what an hour is. We'll make final adjustments
    later.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">How should this be done? The program in my
    timetable takes a number of years.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">We can't wait that long! It has to be done within
    hours or less—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">The planetary damping mechanisms will be only
    quasi-effectual on such short time scales.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You mean things will slosh around a bit?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">That is an understatement.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer thought quickly. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Can't you do something
    like increase the acceleration to a maximum by five hours and then back off
    by ten?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Compared to the damping time scale of the ocean,
    that is a delta function, zero duration. I think a constant acceleration
    would give as reasonable results as might be hoped for.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you know what the effects on the planet will
    be?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">The planet is obviously made to withstand such
    maneuvers. Do you mean effects on the surface?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Of course!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I will engage all the available planetary damping
    mechanisms, but things will, as you say, slosh around a bit. Detailed
    calculations would take several hours. Printouts for your inspections would
    take several years.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer slammed his fist on the console. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do it
    anyway you want! Do it now! Ten hours!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">There is one important thing you have probably
    overlooked,</q> Neberdjer continued with an enraging calm. <q
    ab:speaker="Neberdjer">Admittedly, it is a rather esoteric point.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer was getting very impatient. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And what is
    that?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">I will have to increase the surface gravity
    somewhat.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer, Valyavar, and Barbalan together">You will?</q> all
    three shouted simultaneously. Admittedly, Stringer hadn't foreseen this. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Why?</q> he gulped.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">We will be decreasing the angular momentum of the
    black hole and transferring it to the shell. This is equivalent to taking
    mass from the hole and adding to the shell. Thus, so far, the gravity is
    constant, less due to the decreased mass of the hole, more due to the
    increased mass of the shell. But we have slowed down the rotation of the
    hole in doing so. Efficient energy extraction for planetary operations
    requires that I have the shell rotating as fast as possible. This requires
    that I speed it up once more, or that more rotational energy be placed into
    the hole. Energy is mass. The mass of the hole will increase, and so will
    the surface gravity.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer touched the desk nervously. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That could be
    bad. How much?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">It will be noticeable, but not critical for you
    humans, I would guess. The process will take several days.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Where will you get the extra mass?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">There are a number of possibilities. We could
    dump in more garbage, but at the moment don't have enough in stock. You
    will notice only one other planet in the solar system at present—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">That's fuel?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">What else would it be there for? We could take it
    out of orbit, crumble it up, and bring the pieces down through the Great
    Desert, but that would be cumbersome. The easiest thing to do is to send a
    signal to the next space tangential to this one at the hole and have the
    mass dumped in from that side. Symmetry, you know. One side's as good as
    another.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer blinked. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What are you talking about?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Neberdjer">What makes you think that all of this planet is
    in one Universe?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The silence lasted forever as Stringer's jaw fell open and long fingers
    found their way between strands of black hair. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Indeed,</q> he said quietly, bowing his head, <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">if the world has an edge, it is not here.…</q>
    Eventually he looked up again. In a voice that trailed off to inaudibility,
    he said, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do it. Please do it…now.…</q>
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Several hundred thousand kilometers beneath them, titanic forces began
    work that would transfer the angular momentum of the black hole to the
    outer shell. Inconceivable amounts of energy were tossed about like
    playthings. And Patra-Bannk began to spin faster and faster.…
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    With newly discovered spirit and adrenaline, the Gostum forces attacked
    Triesk, raining projectiles that crashed down on houses, splintered walls,
    and knocked people to the ground. Arrows rained down on Karrxlyn and his
    men, but the numbers became fewer and fewer, and between each barrage his
    men drew closer and closer to the top of the citadel.
  </p>

  <p>
    The men of Glintz were pushed back to the remains of their fleet, half of
    which had been destroyed by the rain of fire from the Gostum catapults and
    a quarter of which were burning now. Fent shot an arrow and was pleased to
    see one of the Gostum felled. His hand reached down to the quiver at his
    side and found it empty.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Gostum were no longer surprised by the magic fence and, as the previous
    Commander had instructed, cut through it quickly, destroying its
    powers. The summit was not far distant now.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the help of his children and a scattering of other, Alhane guided his
    reflectors into the eyes of his enemies as they swarmed up the remains of
    the citadel steps. But there were not enough reflectors now to start fires
    with the diffused sun; there were hardly enough to cause their foe to
    blink. The problem was simple and final: there was not enough of anything
    now, and the Gostum would soon reduce what remained of Ta-tjenen to a heap
    of ashes. The resignation was so complete that distraction had set in, and
    Alhane, at first, did not notice that he was having trouble focusing the
    light continuously. Suddenly he felt slightly, ever so slightly, dizzy, and
    he had to force himself to keep his eyes open and functioning. Had the
    reflectors in his hands become heavier? Or had the last of his strength
    finally given out?
  </p>

  <p>
    Soon the winds began changing direction. Alhane didn't understand that at
    all. Patra-Bannk winds did not gust and veer like that without good
    reason. Why couldn't the winds make up their minds which way they were
    blowing?
  </p>

  <p>
    The dizziness would not go away, and the failing strength in his arms fled
    even faster. The armies below were in confusion. Alhane felt the
    temperature rising. That had never happened so fast. Then the temperature
    fell again and Alhane was doubly confused. And then he heard the shouts all
    around him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="many shouts in stereo">The sun! The sun has moved! We
    disobeyed the Polkraitz and the sun has moved!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The bows from the citadel stopped twanging. Alhane glanced up with the Time
    Keeper's eyes that so accurately knew the position of the sun at all times,
    and nearly fainted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meters below him, the giant warrior Karrxlyn fell to his knees. <q
    ab:speaker="Karrxlyn">Verlaxchi! Were you not on our side?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The winds veered again suddenly, making a complete about-face, and the last
    of the Gostum catapults stopped firing.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Little hope was in evidence as Fent and his men were pressed off the
    beach. <q ab:speaker="Glintz sailors">To the ships! Board the ships!</q> To
    heed the call was their last chance for survival. Ta-tjenen was doomed now,
    and there was no point in denying it further. Fent turned and ran headlong,
    but he jerked to a halt when he saw the Glintzan vessels far out to sea and
    being dragged farther yet as the water rushed away from the beach. Fent
    dropped his sword. If fate was so much against them, it was better to die
    now, immediately. Yet he now saw that the Gostum had halted their advance
    in confusion.  Perhaps they vaguely sensed, as Fent did himself, what was
    soon to follow the water's retreat into the sea. Both armies turned about
    and ran headlong up the shore road as a giant crack of thunder split the
    sky and a huge storm cloud began building over the battlefield. Fent
    stumbled in the sand and picked himself up, overcoming heavy legs. Was
    still another god against him? If so, Fent wasn't going to stop to worry
    about it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fighting had now ceased on all fronts, completely, absolutely. Weapons
    discarded, the armies sought shelter at the acropolis of Ta-tjenen. The
    army of Glintz, preceded in diminishing meters by the Gostum forces,
    reached the citadel, followed by the rumbling of a huge tidal wave.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fent staggered up the ruined steps that he had unsuccessfully fought to
    relieve for so long. Now, as a deafening roar reached up from the beach to
    enfold them, no one attempted to stop him. He pushed and shoved upward
    while a mountainous wave rose and rushed the citadel, sweeping everything
    from its path. Finally, with spray flying through the air, he clung to a
    scaly vine growing on the slopes and collapsed as the rush of water threw
    him off balance. He held his breath for long moments. When that gave out,
    he swallowed water and spat—into air. He opened his eyes. He was still
    alive, but the Gostum camp below him had disappeared. He looked west and
    saw the remains of tents and pieces of catapults being carried away by the
    flooding waters, snagging on the flotsam and jetsam of the obliterated
    command headquarters. Fent pulled himself up and joined the throngs of
    people—Gostum, Trieskan, and Glintzans—who were jamming into the city.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    At the start of the new Bannk three teclads earlier, Paddelack had first
    poked his head up beyond the underground plain. He had looked about him,
    noted the melting snow, sniffed cautiously, and, satisfied at being alive,
    filled his lungs with the still-cool air. He smiled his toothy grin and
    pulled on the tip of his nose. Indeed, it was pleasant to be alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    He and the Liddlefurans had spent the first teclads of the Bannk at
    Liddlefur, their coastal home, fishing and gathering food. When
    reconnaissance had shown Massarat to be deserted, Paddelack led his people
    back to their mountain home to prepare for the next Patra.
  </p>

  <p>
    About halfway along the two-hundred-kilometer trek, when the hills were
    turning into mountains, the ground suddenly rumbled three times in
    succession and Paddelack was thrown off his feet. Soon screams were rising
    about him, and Paddelack, too, caught a glimpse of the sun. It was in the
    wrong place! He took another look. No, he wasn't dreaming. His followers
    gathered about him in search of an explanation while the wind also gathered
    itself into swirling, whirling dervishes. Paddelack could only shake his
    head and stare back into the blank faces surrounding him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Telclads later, another rumble was heard, this time from the
    coast. Paddelack turned around and a gasp rose in his throat. He
    frantically fished his telescope from his pack and through it watched
    Liddlefur disappear under the impact of a tidal wave.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paddelack quickly shouted, <q ab:speaker="Paddelack">Come on! Up to that
    hill!</q> He began climbing in fury but found that his legs were not
    responding. What was this? Why did he feel so heavy? Nonetheless, his will
    overcame his reluctant flesh and he continued climbing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Several telclads after that, Paddelack sat perched atop the mountain
    surveying, not the coastal plain that had once extended below Massarat, but
    a great sea, smooth in texture but for an occasional peak rising above the
    water. He scratched his head and chuckled to himself. It would seem that
    Stringer had indeed discovered something about this ridiculous
    planet. Good. Perhaps sometime in the future, maybe now even
    <em>someday</em> in the future, he would meet Stringer again and get the
    full version of the story. Paddelack chuckled once more. For the moment, at
    least, he was satisfied with the outcome.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Alhane wandered aimlessly throughout a shattered Ta-tjenen. He wiped the
    rain from his dirty face—rain of early Bannk, never before felt, rain mixed
    with his own tears. Was he going mad? What power did Stringer possess to
    cause the sun to move like that, to cause the weather to change more
    rapidly than it had ever changed before, to cause the waters to pile up in
    a great hill? Had reason gone? Had all sense taken flight? Alhane's mind
    futilely grasped for logic and fell into incomprehension.
  </p>

  <p>
    It might have been telclads later—although Alhane didn't know what a
    telclad was any more—when, amid thundering and lightning, he found Effrulyn
    alive, leaning against the north wall. He was breathing heavily, his once
    glorious robe now shredded and covered with mud. Alhane hurried over to him
    and studied the younger man's face for a moment until he himself began to
    shake. Effrulyn stared blankly in return.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What is happening to the world?</q> Alhane cried,
    pummeling the other's shoulders.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">That has never been my concern. It was your
    concern.</q> The words were monotonic and punctuated. Effrulyn tried to
    smile but failed. Then he, too, began to shiver.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane leaned against the wall and stared down at the water lapping against
    his feet. A whining noise that was not the veering wind made itself known
    above the noise of the people and brought his attention to the central
    plaza, where a ship was landing amid the parting throngs who gathered there
    and beyond. They ran over, Effrulyn clumsily in his robe, Alhane clumsily
    in his years, both clumsily from fatigue.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    Stringer stepped to the ground as a clap of thunder burst overhead,
    followed by a rumble beneath his feet. The town shook. Was that an
    earthquake, the planet's homologous structure adjusting to the new balance
    of forces?
  </p>

  <p>
    The trembling stopped after a few moments and Stringer heard the cheers
    rise about him, pulsating throbbing cheers of these people mixed with the
    patter of falling rain. The crowd bowed down before him in expanding
    waves. <q ab:speaker="crowd">Polkraitz! Polkraitz!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    He waved his hands. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No. None of that. No.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    He was unheard except by Valyavar, who commented in Bitter, <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">'Tseems to me that in some sense we might as well
    be. We fulfill all the requirements, yuh?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Except the most important one—</q> Stringer never
    finished the sentence. He spied Alhane pushing through the crowd near him,
    quivering, then sinking to his knees with the others. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">No! Not you, Alhane!</q> he shouted as he ran over to
    the silver-haired man. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Not you,
    Alhane. Please,</q> Stringer begged. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I am not
    Polkraitz. Please…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane shook his head numbly. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">How can I conceive of
    what you have done to our world? It is beyond my understanding of
    anything…</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer held onto his friend and pulled him up by the shoulders. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">You must believe, Alhane, that what I did was not
    magic. You may never understand it—I don't quite myself—but your
    descendants will someday. You must believe that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I'll try,</q> Alhane replied softly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And you, too,</q> Stringer said to Effrulyn, who
    stood behind the Time Keeper.
  </p>

  <p>
    Effrulyn had not bowed down with the others: he was still in shock. Water
    dribbled from his soiled cape. <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">I will remain with
    mathematics. It is much safer, much less disturbing, and…much less
    trivial.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane scowled and then broke out into laughter. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">To
    the end, my young man, to the end,</q> he said, hitting Effrulyn on the
    side. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">All right, Stringer, Polkraitz or not, you
    have done what you have done.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded and began walking through the crowd, unsuccessfully trying
    to get them to their feet. This one would touch his foot, another would bow
    his head as Stringer paused, hair falling into a puddle of water. Most
    would scurry out of the way, but no one would stand. Stringer started out
    slowly. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Get up!</q> he said to each in turn,
    futilely attempting to lift them. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Get up,
    please!</q> Nothing. Then Neberdjer's words came back to him; like many
    things that unique being had said, they held more than a grain of truth. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Don't you see?</q> Stringer shouted. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Don't you understand what you are? You are all the
    same—it is you who are Polkraitz, not I. Don't you understand?</q> There
    was no response. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Please get up!</q> His voice
    became hysterical. He began shouting more and more frantically as he
    struggled with his worshipers. Why weren't they listening? Was his voice
    drowned out by the downpour? Then he spied Taljen. She was on her knees
    with the others. He stepped up to her, but she flinched at his touch and
    lowered her head.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, now he was Polkraitz hero instead of Polkraitz traitor. And what was
    the difference? Indeed, the difference was less than the width of an ant's
    eyebrow.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Taljen, you must also try to understand…</q> he
    said finally as he took her chin in his hand and forced her eyes to meet
    his.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taljen's only response was to jump to her feet and stumble away. Stringer
    followed, the crowd parting for him as he splashed along. He caught up with
    her as she entered the battered remains of the meeting tent. Rain fell
    through where the roof used to be, and beat on the ground. Taljen stood
    under the great map of the world which hung cockeyed from the one rope
    still attached to a surviving beam. Her eyes flitted from the map to
    Stringer and back again for a long moment. Then, with tears in her eyes,
    she took one last look at Stringer, broke into convulsive sobs, and
    fled. Stringer sighed and raised his hand to stop her, but he did not
    follow. He brushed aside the wet hair from his wet eyes and left the ruined
    Center to a dying thunderstorm.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    The weather as well as the gravity began to settle down within the next few
    beclad-days. Every few telclads Stringer would check the pod-trees in the
    park. As he suspected, every night they showed a tendency to close, but
    they never completed the actions before the sun rose again. He came away
    satisfied that they would survive for some ages—even if in a state of
    bewilderment. The water, too, had almost receded to its normal level,
    leaving wet fields ripe for planting. And although it was still too early
    to tell, Stringer had made a bet with Valyavar that the season would be
    spring.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Yes,</q> Stringer said to Alhane in the meeting
    tent, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">you'll find out what a real season is, just
    as you have already found out what a real day and night are. But for the
    moment we have some work to do. Even with all the Gostum and everybody else
    here, you haven't been able to scrounge up enough food to survive much
    longer. I think I can persuade Neberdjer, my friend at the equator, to
    manufacture some food and supplies for you until you learn how to get your
    farming in sequence with the new seasons. That has to be done quickly, and
    perhaps some medicine, too. Maybe Neberdjer will duplicate some that I have
    aboard the shuttle. I'm not a doctor and don't know what you need, but
    we'll try.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Thank you, Stringer,</q> Alhane said.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">And we'll check back with you to see if the length
    of the day is right or whether you want it adjusted. We can do that.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It is a powerful thing to be able to do.…Do you
    realize how much more sensible it would have been to discover gravity after
    you speeded up Patra-Bannk?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Easier, perhaps, but not as gratifying. You did
    almost the impossible. A powerful thing to be able to do.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane smiled. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">There are still some great
    puzzles,</q> he said as they walked out into the afternoon sun. <q
    ab:speaker="Alhane">Effrulyn's constant will have to be measured if we are
    to determine the density of Patra-Bannk. I have an idea of how to do it,
    but it requires knowing how far away Effrulyn's home is.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer chuckled to himself and gazed at the ruined sundial markings
    beneath his feet, the great sundial that kept time for all of
    Ta-tjenen. The metal was broken in places and tarnished by the pyres that
    had burned there. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, you won't need this any
    more, at least not with the same scales.…Effrulyn,</q> he called out to the
    former Gostum standing nearby. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Did I see a
    pendulum clock at the Gostum headquarters?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Yes, the first impure thing I designed there. I've
    never forgiven myself.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer couldn't help but laugh. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Good. Then,
    Alhane, I suggest you switch to constant units of time—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">The clads and belclads were always constant—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Not with your clocks. Use Effrulyn's. It's more
    accurate.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">How do you know?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Effrulyn will explain the details. But since you
    won't believe him, anyway, I suggest you build one and try it yourself. You
    now have more sunrises to check it against.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">But,</q> Effrulyn interrupted, <q
    ab:speaker="Effrulyn">the point of my clock is that it is more accurate
    than one can read the sun's shadow.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">How do you know?</q> Alhane asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">By theory.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Theory! What good is that, I'd like to know? I want
    something to check it against.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Effrulyn">Against what, if it is the most accurate clock
    there is?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer put his hands over his ears until the two stopped arguing. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Alhane,</q> Stringer said when finally there was
    silence, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Taljen…?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">She can't see you,</q> Alhane said, turning away.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">She won't? I understand.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">She's sick. She can't see you even if she wanted to,
    but she doesn't want to.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Sick? Taljen has never been sick for all the time
    I've known her.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Stringer,</q> Alhane said, trying not to look at
    him, <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Taljen tried to kill herself—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What!</q> Stringer shouted.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">I've never heard of such a thing at Ta-tjenen. It
    has never happened before, to my knowledge.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Let me see her!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">No, Stringer, I am not so sure that is a good
    idea.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Let me see her!</q> Stringer shouted again, and
    Alhane gave in. He took Stringer to the house where Taljen was lying. She
    was sleeping on the mat, breathing slowly and regularly.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Is she all right?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">She will be. She is just sleeping now. I am sorry,
    Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No, I'm sorry. I'm just
    beginning to realize, to understand, what I must have done to her
    world.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">It wasn't your fault.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer glared at Alhane in anguish. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Whose was
    it, then? Name one other person who caused this, show me one other fact,
    then I will be satisfied. But you can't—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What point in this, Stringer?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">What point? What point? How could I have been so
    careless—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">Stringer, you are gestating your own hell over a
    missed chance. If you aren't careful it will consume your life. Don't let
    it.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer looked up abruptly. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Alhane, I was going
    to tell you to stop the Parlztluzan—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Alhane">What? With the population decimated now to where it
    was after the revolt? How else could it be kept up?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">I was going to say, <q>Look at Glintz; be like
    them.</q> Or I was going to point to you and Effrulyn, you who hated your
    parents, Effrulyn who lives among Gostum madmen. Yes, I was even going to
    say, <q>Look at us. Maybe it is my species and not yours that is doomed by
    its own exponential growth and it will be the Tjenens who survive and not
    people like me. Why institute the Parlztluzan to lose your
    advantage?</q></q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer glanced down at Taljen. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But there is
    this, too. Is this what I have brought?</q> He sighed. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">I don't know. You will have to decide for
    yourselves.…</q> He bent to kiss the sleeping girl. <q
    ab:speaker="Stringer">Or let Taljen decide. She'll know better than anyone
    else. Of that I am sure.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer and Alhane left the house and began to walk to the ship in the
    cool breeze. They passed by the ruined meeting tent and entered. Stringer
    stared at the map hanging cockeyed. Rage built within him. He wanted to
    scream, <q ab:speaker="Stringer">You, you were the cause of all this!</q>
    He wanted to tear the map down and kick it into splinters and scatter the
    slivers to the four corners of the world. He didn't. Now the world didn't
    have corners. Silently, calmly, as the others looked on, he took his knife
    and cut the map down. He carried it outside, past a pyre burning the
    recently dead. He stopped and lifted the map above his head, high, to throw
    it on the flames. He didn't. He carried it with him to the ship.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Will you keep the name <q>Ta-tjenen</q>? Certainly
    <q>Patra-Bannk</q> will have to be changed.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alhane smiled. <q ab:speaker="Alhane">We'll think of something. How about
    <q>Wet and Dry</q>?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer laughed aloud and with a wave of his hand jumped into the ship.
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan greeted him with an embrace. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">You seem to
    be a little sad,</q> she said, brushing away the tear on his cheek.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">More than a little. I am beginning to realize some
    of the mistakes I've made. I'm not sure if I've saved Ta-tjenen or wrecked
    it completely.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">We did what we could, my Stringer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Did I?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">We did something. It is not expected to be
    perfect.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Well, next time I will do
    better, with your help, I suspect. And now I—we—have some patching up to
    do. First there is Ta-tjenen and then a lot of villages down the coast—if
    they still exist. I'm glad almost everybody was up here for the siege, or
    we might have ended up killing more people than we saved.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Valyavar joined in. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">The decision did smack of
    your impetuosity, but it was made. And now we do what we can with the
    results. It is good to see, at least, that you are making it up to
    them.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer sighed deeply and shook his head. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No. You
    saw what happened at the plaza when we landed. No. There is still no
    fondness for me in Ta-tjenen and no fondness for Ta-tjenen in me. I wish I
    could say I am feeling generous toward them. No.</q> Once again Stringer
    took a deep breath and sighed. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">But that doesn't
    alter what needs to be done, does it?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Both Barbalan and Valyavar nodded. <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">I think,
    Stringer,</q> Barbalan said, <q ab:speaker="Barbalan">that perhaps you
    feel toward them more than you admit.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Do you expect me to be a saint—</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">—or a maniac?</q> Valyavar finished. <q
    ab:speaker="Valyavar">Let's not waste our brains pondering the
    distinction. After all, we have work to do, and we eventually want to get
    around to exploring this planet. Lots to find still. Unless you had planned
    on heading back to Two-Bit.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer chuckled. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">Talk about pointless
    suggestions. You're right, lots to find still. Maybe we can discover when
    the Designers will show up.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">A knotty one, that. God's being somewhat
    malicious these days, isn't he?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Stringer">As you said, he's only interested in truth when it
    suits him.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">That reminds me. Did you ever tell Alhane or
    Effrulyn that this was an artificial planet?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer cocked his head and thought a moment. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">No,
    I'm sure that I didn't. But I suspect it won't be too long before they
    figure it out themselves. Although I could go and tell them. It would make
    life easier.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">No,</q> Valyavar said, catching Stringer by the
    arm. <q ab:speaker="Valyavar">We've changed things too much as it is. Now,
    if God is being malicious, let them find out in their own way.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stringer nodded. He picked up his rodoft from the seat and plucked a
    chord. <q ab:speaker="Stringer">A song?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Barbalan and Valyavar smiled, and they all laughed again.
  </p>

  <h2>Appendix: Days and Nights on Patra-Bannk <br/>(Revised 2020)</h2>

  <p>
    On Earth, because its period of rotation is so short compared to its period
    of revolution around the sun (24 hours versus 365 days) we tend to forget
    that the apparent motion of the sun is, in actuality, caused by
    <em>both</em> the rotation and revolution of the Earth. To be more precise,
    the apparent motion of the sun is due to the differential rotation of the
    Earth, i.e., the sum or difference of the two motions.
  </p>

  <p>
    This effect would become quite visible if the Earth were slowed down until
    its period of rotation was comparable to its period of revolution, or until
    its day was comparable to its year. This is the case of the moon, where
    both periods are equal. Since the moon rotates in the same direction it
    revolves, and with equal rates, we see only one face pointing toward
    Earth. If the Earth is considered as the moon's sun, the moon has no days
    and nights (see Figure 1). Venus also rotates with a period roughly equal
    to its period of revolution around the sun (243 days versus 225 days). In
    this case, however, Venus rotates in the opposite direction from the
    direction of revolution and, as a result, gets days and nights of about ½
    the periods, approximately 117 days. Here we see the effect of the
    differential rotation very well. Since Venus rotates in the opposite
    direction than it revolves, the sun seems to be moving twice as fast as it
    would if Venus did not rotate and thus the days are ½ as long.
  </p>

  <div><img alt="[Figure 1]" width="768" src="f1.svg"/></div>

  <p>
    While writing <i>The World is Round</i> I became interested in the
    daylength for a planet whose relative rates of rotation and revolution were
    arbitrary. I also wanted to take the tilt of the planet into account. To
    keep matters fairly simple, the orbit of the planet was assumed to be
    circular, not elliptical. The final diagram used to set up the problem is
    reproduced in Figure 2.
  </p>

  <div><img alt="[Figure 2]" width="768" src="f2.svg"/></div>

  <p>
    The trick in doing the problem is to pretend the sun is revolving around
    the planet rather than vice-versa. (In fact, an easier way to set up the
    problem than shown here is to assume the planetary rotation axis is
    vertical, along the z-axis, and that the sun’s orbital plane, the plane of
    the ecliptic, is tilted by an angle <i>ϕ</i>.)
  </p>

  <p>
    In either case, you can see by examining Figure 2 that an observer at point
    P rotates around his or her circle of latitude at rate <i>α</i>. The sun
    rotates around the planet at rate <i>β</i>, which is by definition 360
    degrees per sidereal year. (A sidereal year is the time for one revolution
    of the sun around a point fixed in space from the point of view at the
    planet. For the story I assumed that the sun was moving in the opposite
    direction from the planet's rotation, and so <i>β</i> = -360.)
  </p>

  <p>
    We must find <i>ξ</i>, the angle between the observer's zenith and the sun,
    and we need to do this for any time
    <i>t</i>. We want <i>ξ</i> for any rate of rotation <i>α</i>; any tilt of
    planet <i>ϕ</i>; and any latitude <i>θ</i>. By definition, cos <i>ξ</i> is
    the dot product between the unit vectors <b><i>p̅</i></b>
    and <b><i>s̅</i></b>, and so one must find the components of these vectors
    in terms of the required angles and simply multiply them together. Using
    standard spherical trigonometry the result is:
  </p>

  <div>
    cos <i>ξ</i> = (cos <i>θ</i> cos <i>ϕ</i> cos <i>αt</i> +
    sin <i>θ</i> sin <i>ϕ</i>) cos <i>βt</i> +
    cos <i>θ</i> sin <i>αt</i> sin <i>βt</i>
  </div>

  <p>
    To get <i>ξ</i>, finally, we take the inverse cosine of this equation, and
    then plot <i>ξ</i> versus <i>t</i>. This should be done numerically with
    whatever app you prefer, and the result is shown in Figure 3. We have
    incremented <i>t</i> from 0 upward in small values until the day-night
    cycle began repeating itself. For each value of <i>t</i> we have actually
    plotted 90° − <i>ξ</i> which is the angle of sun above the horizon instead
    of the angle from the zenith. Time is in sidereal years which was just an
    easy way to solve the problem. For the purposes of the story you can take
    one sidereal year as 1000 Earth days. Thus, on the graph, .2 sidereal years
    is 200 Earth days, etc. With a finer scale you would see that the Weird
    Bannk lasts 181 Earth days, while the Killer Bannk lasts 240.

  <h2>A Note from the Technical Illustrator 2020</h2>

  <p>
    It was not feasible to access the original cover art by Ralph
    McQuarrie. There were multiple printing runs of the book, with variable
    results, most notably an orange title version with a warm, light
    background, and a yellow title version with a cold, dark
    background. Comparing a scan of an unread pristine yellow version, and a
    scan of Tony's orange version, it was a tough call to not use the pristine
    yellow version, but it did not respond well to color correction. The orange
    version required extensive digital retouching, although removing the logo
    and price was a joy. If you have a clean copy of the orange version, please
    let me know.

    The original figures from the book are difficult to read, so rather than
    duplicate them, new figures were designed to convey the same information
    more clearly. Figure 1 replaces the stick man with circular arrows showing
    the direction of rotation, and orients the shaded orb halves to match the
    rotation. Figure 2 uses transparent shading and more explicit vector
    notation including subscripts for the vector angles. Figure 3 replaces the
    point plot with a graph, adds the missing parameters necessary for plotting
    the graph, and starts at dawn of the Killer Bannk, instead of at solstice,
    so the Killer Bannk is not split in half.

  <h2>Autobiographical Note 2020</h2>

  <p>
    <i>The World is Round</i> was written mostly in 1975, immediately after my
    graduation from Swarthmore College. I have occasionally been asked whether
    it is true that I started writing it during final exams period in order to
    avoid studying. Yes. Though I had been planning the book throughout the
    school year, I did begin the writing during finals, to the considerable
    detriment of my grades. During the summer the unfinished manuscript was
    accidentally left in the trunk of a car while I was hitchhiking around
    Scotland, but miraculously returned overnight to the hostel where I was
    staying. I can only surmise that the taxi driver whom I had unsuccessfully
    hired to find the missing car finally came across it, but I never
    discovered exactly how the miracle came to pass.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wrote much, if not most, of <i>The World is Round</i> the following
    semester while studying at Cambridge University in England, finishing it in
    1976. It was published by Ballantine/Del Rey Books in 1978, by which time I
    was a graduate student at the physics department at The University of
    Texas, Austin. My doctoral research on big bang cosmology was carried out
    at The Center for Relativity there, and I received a PhD from UT in 1981.
  </p>

  <p>
    After graduation I did post-doctoral fellowships at Oxford, Moscow State
    University, and The University of Cape Town. Since those days I have taught
    physics at a number of universities, among them Princeton, Harvard, and
    NYU. At the same time I have continued to write and to date have published
    twelve books, both fiction and nonfiction. As of 2020, I have retired from
    teaching and am currently writing a <q>Little Book on the Big Bang</q> for
    Harvard University Press.

    Although <i>The World is Round</i> was my first published book, and for
    that reason holds a special place in my heart, it was written by a much
    younger man with whom I no longer have much in common. I doubt I would have
    ever undertaken to have it republished, and so let me take this opportunity
    to thank Ben Pfaff and Christina Palmer, two unknown fans of the novel, who
    entirely of their own accord decided that this long out-of-print work
    should be made available in electronic format. As <i>The World is Round</i>
    was originally published before the advent of digital media, the decision
    was made to input the text manually and to redraw the appendix figures from
    scratch. The project entailed an enormous amount of work, and all credit
    goes to them.

  <h3>The Planet of Starless Nights</h3>

  <p>
    Their world was 50 times bigger than any world had a right to be.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their days were a year long. They had no moon. Normal seasons didn't exist,
    and when the natives weren't worried about being roasted alive, they lived
    in dread of freezing to death. Paddelack wasn't a native of Patra-Bannk,
    but he had been trapped there long enough to hate its insanity with every
    fiber of his being.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then a crew from far-off Two-Bit arrived to search for a fantastic city and
    its fabulous treasures. Paddelack greeted them with a vengeance and begged
    for passage off this crazy world. But the mission commander had something
    else in mind, and he needed Paddelack's help.
  </p>

  <p>
    So Paddelack stayed on the world he hated, an unwilling captive of a
    mercenary band. Together they traversed the face of this bizarre
    planet—plagued by unpredictable natives, beset by irrational weather, and
    thoroughly confused by the enormity of their predicament.
