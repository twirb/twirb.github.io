  <p>
    <i>The World is Round</i> was written mostly in 1975, immediately after my
    graduation from Swarthmore College. I have occasionally been asked whether
    it is true that I started writing it during final exams period in order to
    avoid studying. Yes. Though I had been planning the book throughout the
    school year, I did begin the writing during finals, to the considerable
    detriment of my grades. During the summer the unfinished manuscript was
    accidentally left in the trunk of a car while I was hitchhiking around
    Scotland, but miraculously returned overnight to the hostel where I was
    staying. I can only surmise that the taxi driver whom I had unsuccessfully
    hired to find the missing car finally came across it, but I never
    discovered exactly how the miracle came to pass.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wrote much, if not most, of <i>The World is Round</i> the following
    semester while studying at Cambridge University in England, finishing it in
    1976. It was published by Ballantine/Del Rey Books in 1978, by which time I
    was a graduate student at the physics department at The University of
    Texas, Austin. My doctoral research on big bang cosmology was carried out
    at The Center for Relativity there, and I received a PhD from UT in 1981.
  </p>

  <p>
    After graduation I did post-doctoral fellowships at Oxford, Moscow State
    University, and The University of Cape Town. Since those days I have taught
    physics at a number of universities, among them Princeton, Harvard, and
    NYU. At the same time I have continued to write and to date have published
    twelve books, both fiction and nonfiction. As of 2020, I have retired from
    teaching and am currently writing a <q>Little Book on the Big Bang</q> for
    Harvard University Press.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although <i>The World is Round</i> was my first published book, and for
    that reason holds a special place in my heart, it was written by a much
    younger man with whom I no longer have much in common. I doubt I would have
    ever undertaken to have it republished, and so let me take this opportunity
    to thank Ben Pfaff and Christina Palmer, two unknown fans of the novel, who
    entirely of their own accord decided that this long out-of-print work
    should be made available in electronic format. As <i>The World is Round</i>
    was originally published before the advent of digital media, the decision
    was made to input the text manually and to redraw the appendix figures from
    scratch. The project entailed an enormous amount of work, and all credit
    goes to them.
